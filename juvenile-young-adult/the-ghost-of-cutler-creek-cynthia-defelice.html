  <title>The Ghost of Cutler Creek - Cynthia DeFelice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The third book about Allie Nichols, &quot;ghost magnet&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Nichols has hardly laid the last spirit to rest when she&#39;s sure that another one is trying to reach her. But how can Allie help a ghost who won&#39;t speak? All she has to go on is a sound -- a sort of whine -- and a smell. At the same time, a strange boy joins her sixth-grade class. Allie doesn&#39;t understand why L. J. Cutler would start a new school at the end of the year, or why he&#39;s such a surly kid. She wants nothing to do with him. Then Mr. Henry, a teacher she loves, asks Allie to dog-sit Hoover, his golden retriever, while he&#39;s away and to befriend L.J. over the summer. She&#39;s delighted to spend time with Hoover, but she hardly looks forward to visiting L. J. Cutler -- until she discovers a connection between L.J., the ghost, and Hoover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new book about Allie Nichols is another masterful novel of suspense by an author who consistently writes solid, entertaining stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
