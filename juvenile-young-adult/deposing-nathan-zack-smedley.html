  <title>Deposing Nathan - Zack Smedley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A heartbreaking and important read.&quot; --Caleb Roehrig, author of &lt;i&gt;Last Seen Leaving &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;[A]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; layered, complex depiction of questioning (bi)sexuality..&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heartbreaking case worth revisiting again and again&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt;&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nate never imagined that he would be attacked by his best friend. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sixteen years, Nate was the perfect son--the product of a no-nonsense upbringing and deep spiritual faith. Then he met Cam, who pushed him to break rules, dream, and accept himself. Conflicted, Nate began to push back. With each push, the boys became more entangled in each others&#39; worlds...but they also spiraled closer to their breaking points. And now all of it has fallen apart after a fistfight-turned-near-fatal-incident--one that&#39;s left Nate with a stab wound and Cam in jail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Nate is being ordered to give a statement, under oath, that will send his best friend to prison. The problem is, the real story of what happened between them isn&#39;t as simple as anyone thinks. With all eyes on him, Nate must make his confessions about what led up to that night with Cam...and in doing so, risk tearing both of their lives apart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
