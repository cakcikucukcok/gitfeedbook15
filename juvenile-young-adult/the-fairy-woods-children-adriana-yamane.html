  <title>The Fairy Woods Children - Adriana Yamane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Much of the education of children is based on the antithesis between good and bad. The images of bad are supposed to be the dark background against which the good can shine, like courage shining through in times of danger. The problem with this approach is that the good has only the chance to shine but not to grow. The Fairy Woods Children thus tries to bring a new approach that allows goodness to grow and to expand in childrens consciousness, without the need of a fear-based background scenario. While this may sound boring to grown-up people who are used mainly to the strife of their daily life with all its troubles and fears, small children do not need to have this handicap. From an early age, they need to be allowed to grow beyond this stage at which humankind is now, and they need to learn more about the infinite possibilities that may lie before them in the future. A lot of misunderstandings and conflicts arise from the lack of heart-to-heart communication, which is the central point in the seven stories of the book. Each story, meant to be read at bedtime, brings to the surface a deep inner longing of the soul to express itself. As a child, these were the stories I would have liked to hear, and these were the teachings I would have liked to receive, as they can greatly eliminate the need of the good versus bad antithesis. And this is the reason why I would like to offer them to children and people like me, who may appreciate art and beauty, and who may wish to create for their families a lifestyle which is more soulful and kind." />
