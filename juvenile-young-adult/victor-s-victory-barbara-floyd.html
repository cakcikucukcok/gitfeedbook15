  <title>Victor’S Victory - Barbara Floyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victor is an old Volkswagen bus that has been abandoned, discarded, and left alone behind an old barn in the middle of a field that has tall weeds because his owner had bought a brand-new car. Victor has many little flaws, but nothing that a little tender, loving care could not mend. Victor is very lonely and is feeling sad and unwanted. Sometimes, some little boys come by and pretend to be driving him, which makes him happy. But other times, bigger boys come by and throw rocks at him, making him feel even worse.
Then one day, a tow truck comes, hooks Victor up, and pulls him down the road backward. Victor wonders where he is going. Is he being taken to a junkyard to sit with all the other unwanted cars? Is he going to be taken apart piece by piece and used as spare parts? Is he going to be crushed for scrap metal?
But then, he is pulled into a garage at a nice little family home. For the next several weeks, Victor is refurbished completely. He is now being used every Sunday to pick up happy boys and girls for church.
Once again, Victor is feeling useful, handsome, and happy!" />
