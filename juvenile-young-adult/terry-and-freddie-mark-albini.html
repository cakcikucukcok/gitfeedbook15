  <title>Terry and Freddie - Mark Albini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Against his mothers wishes, Freddie the fish plays hooky from school to race against Terry the Turtle. All of their friends have gathered at the pond to watch the contest, including Jimmy the Giraffe, Howie the Horse, and Bobo the Mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddie is certain hell win. But the race doesnt turn out as planned when an uninvited guest makes an appearance. Some quick thinking by Terry saves the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third book in the series, Terry and Freddie narrates a heartwarming, rhyming story of two animals who live at the Rescue Ranch, a peaceful place where animals roam in wide open space and take care of one another. The tale offers important lessons for all: moms have rules for a reason, and there are consequences when you dont listen to your parents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
