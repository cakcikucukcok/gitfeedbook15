  <title>Olive and Babyland - Marchie Bracken, Jordan Nicole Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When five-year-old Olive learns that Samanthas grandmother has died, she goes to her daddy and asks what dying is. In order to answer her question, Olives daddy tells her a tale from when he was a little boy about a baby bird that had fallen out of its nest. The story of what happens next helps Olive understand that death is about love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This childrens story seeks in a loving, ecumenical, and sensitive way to help children understand what death is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March Bracken has, again, articulated death in a manner that is light and natural. Discussions of death can be just as difficult with adults as with children. This story breathes its love light onto a topic we find so challenging to approach.  I can absolutely see how this soft tale of a child and her father could positively impact those dealing with stages of dementia. The story is refreshing, brief and honest.&lt;br /&gt;
Tricia James, LCSW, hospice social worker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Olive and Babyland, March Bracken has written a tender and evocative tale of death and rebirth for children and their adults, a tale that explains death in gentle words and images that speak in love light.&lt;br /&gt;
