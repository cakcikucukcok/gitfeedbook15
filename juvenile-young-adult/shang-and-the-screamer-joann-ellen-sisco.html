  <title>Shang and the Screamer - Joann Ellen Sisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These two special two-legged animals were actually neighbors, but they didnt know it until they met at Wildwood Village.
   The two feathered animals with only two legs were enemies and they had known it from the first moment they met.  When a terrible fight occurred, it gave the two girls a surprising thing to put in their scrapbooks, but it was doubtful that it did anything for the fighters except to loose a few feathers.  If Ladycat had not appeared, they might have continued to fight until they had no feathers at all!
  This is the fifteenth book of the Twenty Book Series, Wildwood Village Summer Camp, where 25 girls, ages ten to twelve, could spend a summer with each other and the local animals of central Oklahoma." />
