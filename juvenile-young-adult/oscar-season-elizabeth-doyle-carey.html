  <title>Oscar Season - Elizabeth Doyle Carey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brought to you by a writer of the best-selling &lt;b&gt;CUPCAKE DIARIES&lt;/b&gt; series…
The new &lt;b&gt;JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS&lt;/b&gt; series is wholesome summer fun for young YA readers! 
Join the girls of the Junior Lifeguards as they continue their summery adventures in Cape Cod, where ice cream, lip gloss, and sand-between-your-toes combine with crushes and life skills for fun beachfront escapades!
Junior Lifeguards basic training isn’t for wimps. Thirteen-year-old aspiring actress In &lt;b&gt;OSCAR SEASON&lt;/b&gt;, Selena Diaz learns this the hard way during her first week on the squad. Along with best pals Jenna, Piper, and Ziggy, Selena is just getting her feet wet as a lifeguard trainee and the going is tough. 
What’s worse, she’s also dealing with a new job, swim lessons, a show-tunes singing math tutor, and a haughty neighbor who’s also kind of her boss. But Selena uses her showbiz enthusiasm to tackle every problem, and squad cutie Hayden Jones and stray kitten Oscar brighten each day. Meanwhile, they soon discover that a real Hollywood star is shining brightly in their midst—right here on the Cape!
Praise for The Callahan Cousins, also by Elizabeth Doyle Carey:
&lt;b&gt;“I loved this spirited and heartwarming summer story about growing up, finding adventure, and keeping family bonds.”&lt;/b&gt;
--Ann M. Martin, author of The Babysitters Club series
&lt;b&gt;“A good choice for fans of the American Girls series.”&lt;/b&gt;
--School Library Journal
&lt;b&gt;“Appealing…Carey’s narrative harks back to wholesome tales of a bygone era.”&lt;/b&gt;
--Publisher’s Weekly
&lt;b&gt;“A good, old-fashioned (but still up to date) read.”&lt;/b&gt;
--YA Books Central
&lt;b&gt;“Refreshingly sweet-tempered.”&lt;/b&gt;
