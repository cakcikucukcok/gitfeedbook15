In this dark urban fantasy from acclaimed author Victoria Schwab&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a young woman and a young man must choose whether to become heroes or villains&amp;#8212;and friends or enemies&amp;#8212;with the future of their home at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of two books, &lt;em&gt;This Savage Song &lt;/em&gt;is a must-have for fans of Holly Black, Maggie Stiefvater, and Laini Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Harker and August Flynn are the heirs to a divided city&amp;#8212;a city where the violence has begun to breed actual monsters. All Kate wants is to be as ruthless as her father, who lets the monsters roam free and makes the humans pay for his protection. All August wants is to be human, as good-hearted as his own father, to play a bigger role in protecting the innocent&amp;#8212;but he&amp;#8217;s one of the monsters.

Her heroes will face monsters intent on destroying them from every side&amp;#8212;including the monsters within.&lt;/p&gt;" />
