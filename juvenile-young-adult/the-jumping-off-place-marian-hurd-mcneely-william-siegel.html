  <title>The Jumping-Off Place - Marian Hurd McNeely, William Siegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;In the summer of 1910, four orphans leave their home in Wisconsin to &quot;prove up&quot; their claim to a parcel of land on the South Dakota prairie. Seventeen-year-old Becky Linville and her younger siblings &amp;#8212; Dick, Phil, and Joan &amp;#8212; hadn&#39;t intended to move to the newly opened Rosebud Reservation by themselves. But with their Uncle Jim&#39;s untimely death, the children are forced to follow up on the claim without adult supervision. &lt;BR&gt;Uncle Jim left detailed instructions for his young relatives; but right from the start, homesteading turns out to be far more difficult than they expected. A family of ornery squatters have set up a shanty on the Linville claim and vandalized the property. A drought threatens the summer corn crop, and winter brings blizzards, relentless cold, and near-starvation. But prairie life isn&#39;t as lonely as it seems, and the Linvilles gradually form strong bonds within their far-flung community. The support of their new neighbors, together with their own growing self-reliance, helps the children rise to each challenge. An exciting tale of adventure, resilience, and triumph over adversity, this 1930 Newbery Honor Book was inspired by author Marian Hurd McNeely&#39;s homesteading years.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
