  <title>LAND OTTER THE INDIAN - A Native American Tlingit story from the North West - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 212&lt;br /&gt;
In this 212th issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates the American-Indian story of Land-Otter. A story from the Tlingit tribe on the Alaskan coast of the North West United States.&lt;br /&gt;
A year after a man and wife lose a son, the crops of their tribe fail and the men of the tribe took to the waters of the rivers, lakes and the sea to fish. Their main aim was to catch was halibut, to keep them from starving. But even the fish catch was meagre and the people grew thinner and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just when all seems lost, they hear a sound in the drying house and go to investigate. They find two freshly caught devifish (octopus). This fills them with hope and joy as they can use the devilfish as bait for the next day&amp;rsquo;s fishing.&lt;br /&gt;
But the wife of the man who found the devilfish is mystified and wonders at just who brought the devilfish. This is when things start to change&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
You are invited to download and read the story of Land-Otter and the fate of the tribe. Has his death cast a blight over the crops, or is it something else?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
