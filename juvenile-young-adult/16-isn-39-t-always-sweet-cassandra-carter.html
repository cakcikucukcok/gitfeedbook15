So when she hears about an open casting call for the hottest rapper&#39;s new video, she has the confidence to go for it. She and her best friend, Adrienne, try out with hundreds of hopefuls, but only Jordan makes it. Adrienne seems fine with it. But when Jordan starts getting some serious attention, Adrienne turns into a hater. And after Jordan has an innocent in-the-hall conversation with Adrienne&#39;s ex-boyfriend&amp;#151;they dated for one week, like four years ago!&amp;#151;Adrienne plots to ruin Jordan&#39;s life by spreading rumors, writing stuff on the bathroom walls and telling Jordan she&#39;d be better off dead. Suddenly Jordan&#39;s popularity is fading. Forget sweet sixteen. She soon discovers that what she needs most is to find the strength to be herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
