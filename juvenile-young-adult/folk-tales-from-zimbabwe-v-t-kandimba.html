  <title>Folk Tales from Zimbabwe - V. T. Kandimba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While he was growing up, Tsuro, the bunny rabbit, learned the
hard way to treat others as he wanted to be treated by them.
Being street smart is good, but its not always the best way to
live with others. As children, we must never look down on people. We
can learn something from our friends no matter how different they are.
Amazingly, Kamba, the turtle proved that slow is the new fast.
I, Victoria Taurai Kandimba, a mother of
four, born and raised in rural Zimbabwe
am a natural storyteller. I was inspired
by my grandparents who were great folk
storytellers as I grew up. I moved to the USA
in 2000. In the warm evenings, in a dimly
lit hut, after dinner, my two grandmothers,
Mandisiya and Taurai, would entertain
the family with these folk stories while
we shelled peanuts. Everyone took part in
discussions to discipline or praise characters
in these tales and we thoroughly enjoyed it. They were parables that
taught children to grow into good responsible people." />
