  <title>It&#39;s the First Day of School...Forever! - R. L. Stine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the first day of school, Artie falls out of his bed and hits his head. Hard. He tells his mom he&#39;s dizzy and she says, &quot;You&#39;re just worried about your first day in a new school.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At breakfast, his little brother, Eddie, splashes syrup in his hair, and there&#39;s no time to wash it. Artie has to go to school with syrup-hair. And then, on the way there, he gets splashed by a puddle that makes him look like he wet his pants. It&#39;s not just the first day of school; it&#39;s the worst day of school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the second day of school, Artie falls out of bed and hits his head. Hard. He tells his mom he&#39;s dizzy and she says, &quot;You&#39;re just worried about your first day in a new school.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huh? Today is just like the day before. Can Artie find a way to change it, before it&#39;s the first day of school...forever? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A fast and goofy romp&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;) that &quot;delivers the hilarity and horror that readers love&quot; (&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;), from the master of children&#39;s horror, R.L.
