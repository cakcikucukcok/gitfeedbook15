  <title>The Adventures of Petey Pots and Pans: My Name Is Not a Game - Dr. Bashir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Petey is as normal as can be. Even so, there is something very unique about Petey, something his mother gave him. Can you guess what it is? It&#39;s his name-Petey Pots and Pans. But not everybody realizes how special his name is. As a matter of fact, some people think it&#39;s a very strange name. They tease Petey Pots and Pans about his name, and that makes him feel just awful.   One day, when Petey Pots and Pans wakes up with a stomachache, his mother takes him to see Dr. Bill. But when Dr. Bill can&#39;t find anything wrong with Petey, his mother is sure she understands why Petey Pots and Pans doesn&#39;t want to go to school. She has to do something to make Petey feel better, and quickly. Otherwise he could miss out on a good deal of learning.   Petey&#39;s mother knows that Petey Pots and Pans could grow up to be anything he chooses. But she has to find a way to inspire Petey to be his very best even when others are mean to him. What will she do?" />
