  <title>My Basmati Bat Mitzvah - Paula J. Freedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Â &lt;/div&gt;
During the fall leading up to her bat mitzvah, Tara (Hindi for &quot;star+?) Feinstein has a lot more than her Torah portion on her mind. Between Hebrew school and study sessions with the rabbi, there doesn&#39;t seem to be enough time to hang out with her best friend Ben-O--who might also be her boyfriend--and her other best friend, Rebecca, who&#39;s getting a little too cozy with the snotty Sheila Rosenberg. Not to mention working on her robotics project with the class clown Ryan Berger, or figuring out what to do with a priceless heirloom sari that she accidentally ruined. Amid all this drama, Tara considers how to balance her Indian and Jewish identities and what it means to have a bat mitzvah while questioning her faith.&lt;br&gt;
With the cross-cultural charm of &lt;i&gt;Bend It Like Beckham&lt;/i&gt;, this delightful debut novel is a classic coming-of-age story and young romance with universal appeal.&lt;br&gt;
Â &lt;br&gt;
&lt;!--?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /--&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;My Basmati Bat Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;In my opinion, &lt;i&gt;My Basmati Bat Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; shows that everyone is different in their own way and some get the advantage of being culturally diverse. I rate the book 5 stars!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--Shivani Desai, age 13&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The latest spunky heroine of South Asian+&quot;Jewish heritage to grace middle-grade fiction, Tara Feinstein, 12, charms readers from the get-go in this strong, funny debut.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Tara&#39;s inquisitiveness, openness, and determination to chart her own path stand out in this warm story of family, faith and the ways people are unique yet intertwined.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Â &lt;br&gt;
&quot;With a conversational and authentic tween voice, Tara invites readers into her world as she explores the larger issues of faith, compassion, and tradition while confronting the awkwardness that is puberty--her questions regarding God are poignant and relatable while her opinions on training bras are simply spot-on...&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;The Bulletin of The Center for Children&#39;s Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Authors often mention but then shrink from exploring in depth their characters&#39; mixed religious heritage; it&#39;s a sensitive subject that demands close scrutiny. Freedman bucks that trend, avoiding didacticism by portraying broader issues through Tara&#39;s personality and unique circumstances. As Tara learns in this skillful exploration, an important source of her special strengths--questioning spirit, empathy and strong ethical compass--is her mixed heritage.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;The Jewish Daily Forward&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This story will have resonance for many children of many faiths at the cusp of religious adulthood.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;As she makes her way through these challenges, she learns a great deal about friendship, family, and heritage. Freedman handles the ethnic and religious diversity of Tara&#39;s family and friends with a light touch, but doesn&#39;t shrink from exploring some of the complexities of a dual heritage.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Â &quot;This book&#39;s well-drawn characters bring two colorful cultures to vibrant life. The contemporary urban setting, cast with touches of humor and romance, frame mature ideas of peer and self-acceptance in a familiar, lighthearted world. Middle grade girls will readily befriend Tara and pick up new cultural understanding.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
