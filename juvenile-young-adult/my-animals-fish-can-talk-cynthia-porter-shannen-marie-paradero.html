  <title>My Animals &amp; Fish Can Talk - Cynthia Porter, Shannen Marie Paradero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Readers will cruise through many human emotions that come alive in these stories involving animals and fish. Anticipation is prominent throughout your reading journey as you wonder what happens next. Humanization via emotions/motives/want/desires/curiosity is inserted into these imaginary animals. Their dialogue advances the understanding of their actions. Its always like they have to talk only when absolutely necessary. This is a feel-good, satisfying read, and I believe that you will want to read these stories repeatedly and never get bored. 
Take this ride with Barry the Panda as he enters the forbidden forest with his bamboo in search of mystery and more bamboo, and root for Freckles the Cat to find Sunshine the Cat. Hope that Freckles and his owner can return Sunshine to his owner and his new home. Admire the devotion and connection that Jerry the Boy and Essie the Cow possess and follow their journey to understanding and closure. Enjoy the happy and surprise ending for an unselfish boy who accepts his fate but wants the best for others. Root for the Yellow Fish who prompted the boy to have hope and a wish for himself." />
