      <meta name="description" content="Augie Hobble lives in a fairy tale--or at least Fairy Tale Place, the down-on-its-luck amusement park managed by his father. Yet his life is turning into a nightmare: he&#39;s failed creative arts and has to take summer school, the girl he has a crush on won&#39;t acknowledge him, and Hogg Wills and the school bullies won&#39;t leave him alone. Worse, a succession of mysterious, possibly paranormal, events have him convinced that he&#39;s turning into a werewolf. At least Augie has his notebook and his best friend Britt to confide in--until the unthinkable happens and Augie&#39;s life is turned upside down, and those mysterious, possibly paranormal, events take on a different meaning." />
