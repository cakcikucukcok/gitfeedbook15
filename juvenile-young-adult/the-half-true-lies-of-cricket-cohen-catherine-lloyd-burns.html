  <title>The Half-True Lies of Cricket Cohen - Catherine Lloyd Burns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catherine Lloyd Burns&#39;s&lt;i&gt; The Half-True Lies of Cricket Cohen &lt;/i&gt;is an outlandish tale of a grandmother and her granddaughter whose us-against-the-world friendship teaches them both about what it means to tell the truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cricket Cohen is &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;a liar. She just enhances the truth. Often. Cricket is a natural-born storyteller. She is also a part-time geologist, a Greek professor, and a certified brain surgeon with a thriving private medical practice. Yes, her patients are all stuffed animals, but the work is still very demanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite her busy schedule, Cricket always has time for Dodo, her equally imaginative grandmother. And one Manhattan weekend when Cricket finds herself in hot water with her teacher and thoroughly fed up with her controlling parents, she and Dodo hit the pavement. What could possibly go wrong when two people with a habit of confusing fact and fantasy take off looking for adventure? Lots, it turns out, and eleven-year-old Cricket finds herself face-to-face with some hard truths about love, family, and getting home again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
