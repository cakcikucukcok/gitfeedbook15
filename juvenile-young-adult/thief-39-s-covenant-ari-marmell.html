  <title>Thief&#39;s Covenant - Ari Marmell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once she was Adrienne Satti. An orphan of Davillon, she had somehow escaped destitution and climbed to the ranks of the city&#39;s aristocracy in a rags-to-riches story straight from an ancient fairy tale. Until one horrid night, when a conspiracy of forces--human and other--stole it all away in a flurry of blood and murder. Today she is Widdershins, a thief making her way through Davillon&#39;s underbelly with a sharp blade, a sharper wit, and the mystical aid of Olgun, a foreign god with no other worshippers but Widdershins herself. It&#39;s not a great life, certainly nothing compared to the one she once had, but it&#39;s hers. But now, in the midst of Davillon&#39;s political turmoil, an array of hands are once again rising up against her, prepared to tear down all that she&#39;s built. The City Guard wants her in prison. Members of her own Guild want her dead. And something horrid, something dark, something ancient is reaching out for her, a past that refuses to let her go. Widdershins and Olgun are going to find answers, and justice, for what happened to her--but only if those who almost destroyed her in those years gone by don&#39;t finish the job first. From the Hardcover edition." />
