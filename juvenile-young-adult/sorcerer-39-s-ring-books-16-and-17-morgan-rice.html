  <title>Sorcerer&#39;s Ring (Books 16 and 17) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;THE SORCERER&#39;S RING has all the ingredients for an instant success: plots, counterplots, mystery, valiant knights, and blossoming relationships replete with broken hearts, deception and betrayal. It will keep you entertained for hours, and will satisfy all ages. Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.&quot;--Books and Movie Reviews. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bundle includes the last two books in Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 Bestselling fantasy series THE SORCERER&#39;S RING (A JOUST OF KNIGHTS and THE GIFT OF BATTLE), a 17 book epic fantasy series with over 1,000 five star reviews. These two bestselling novels are both here in one convenient file, and offer a great introduction to the SORCERER&#39;S RING.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A JOUST OF KNIGHTS, Thorgrin and his brothers follow Guwayne&#39;s trail at sea, pursuing him to the Isle of Light. But as they reach the ravaged isle and the dying Ragon, all may be just too late. Darius finds himself brought to the Empire capital, and to the greatest arena of them all. Gwendolyn is pulled into the heart of the family dynamics of the royal court of the Ridge, as the King and Queen beg her for a favor. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In THE GIFT OF BATTLE, Thor meets his greatest and final challenge, as he quests deeper into the Land of Blood to attempt to rescue Guwayne. Encountering foes more powerful than he ever imagined, Thor soon realizes he is up against an army of darkness, one for which his powers are no match. Gwendolyn keeps her vow to the King of the Ridge, entering the tower and confronting the cult leader to learn what secret he is hiding. The revelation sends her to Argon, and ultimately to Argon&#39;s master-where she learns the greatest secret of all, one which may alter the destiny of her people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, THE GIFT OF BATTLE is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders." />
