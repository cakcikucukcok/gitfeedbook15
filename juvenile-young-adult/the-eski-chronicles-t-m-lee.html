      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a puppy named Eski wakes up to hear her cage at the animal shelter rattling, she is first nervous and then excited. A family has come to adopt her! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eski is excited to meet Dad, Mom, and most of all, Emma, the little girl who is going to take care of her. Shes very happy to be going to a new home; theres a warm bed, tasty food, and toys and people to play with. But when she meets Rex and Debo, the two cats who already live with the family, they hiss and are not glad to see her.
