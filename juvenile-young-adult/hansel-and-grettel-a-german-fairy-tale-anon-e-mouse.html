  <title>HANSEL AND GRETTEL - A German Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 100&lt;br /&gt;
In this the 100th issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates one of the most famous German fairytales - &amp;ldquo;Hansel and Grettel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Hansel and Grettel&amp;rsquo;s mother has died leaving their poor woodcutter father to bring them up. Because he is out of the house all day he really cannot care for them, so makes a marriage of convenience with a widow from a nearby village. But is the marriage so convenient after all?&lt;br /&gt;
The woman turns out to be mean and nasty and with money in short supply, the widow suggests to the woodcutter leaving Hansel and Grettel in the forest so there would be more to go around. But she would, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t she. After all they&amp;rsquo;re not her children&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
The woodcutter reluctantly agrees. Twice he tries but cannot leave his young children to fend for themselves against the elements. However, the mean wife forces his hand on the third attempt and Hansel and Grettel are left to take care of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
But does the whole situation turn out as bad as it sounds?&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re invited to download and read the story of Hansel and Grettel and their escapades with the wicked witch of the forest.&lt;br /&gt;
