  <title>Accidents of Nature - Harriet McBryde Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m in the middle of a full-blown spaz-attack, and I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t care at all. At home I always try to act normal, and spaz-attacks definitely aren&#39;t normal. Here, people understand. They know a spaz-attack signals that I&#39;m &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;excited. They&#39;re excited too, so they squeal with me; some even spaz on purpose, if you can call that spazzing . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;An unforgettable coming-of-age novel about what it&#39;s like to live with a physical disability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the summer of 1970. Seventeen-year-old Jean has cerebral palsy, but she&#39;s always believed she&#39;s just the same as everyone else. She&#39;s never really known another disabled person before she arrives at Camp Courage. As Jean joins a community unlike any she has ever imagined, she comes to question her old beliefs and look at the world in a new light. The camp session is only ten days long, but that may be all it takes to change a life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Holt published Harriet McBryde Johnson&#39;s adult memoir, &lt;i&gt;Too Late to Die Young&lt;/i&gt;, in April 2005. Ms. Johnson has been featured in The New York Times Magazine and has been an activist for disability rights for many years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
