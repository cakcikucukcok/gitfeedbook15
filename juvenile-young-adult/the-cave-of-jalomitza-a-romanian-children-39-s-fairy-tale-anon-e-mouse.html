  <title>THE CAVE OF JALOMITZA- A Romanian Children&#39;s Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 267&lt;br /&gt;
In this 267th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Romanian story of &amp;ldquo;THE CAVE OF JALOMITZA.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
In crossing the pass between the peaks of V&amp;icirc;rfal cu Dor and Furnica, on the other side of the Bucegi, you come upon the Jalomitza river. One of the springs which feed it rises hard by, in a vast stalactite cave, at the entrance of which stands a small cloister. From time immemorial it has always been said that there is no ending to this cave, and that a man who once went in there has never been seen again to this day.&lt;br /&gt;
The cave was once inhabited by a terrible enchanter, of whom it was told that he carried off all the fairest maidens roundabout&amp;mdash;carried them off out of the fields, from their parents&amp;rsquo; cottages, yes, even from before the marriage-altar. They all followed him, without resistance, but no one ever saw them more. Many a bold youth had sworn to go and free them, and had even marched bravely into the cave and called the enchanter by name: &amp;ldquo;Bucur! Bucur!&amp;rdquo; but not one had ever caught a glimpse either of Bucur or of the maidens.&lt;br /&gt;
But in the pretty village of Rucar, at the foot of the Bucegi, there dwelt a beautiful maiden, named Jalomitza, who had been rash enough to say that she engaged never to follow the enchanter, no matter in what shape he might appear before her, or with what promises he might try to entice her.&lt;br /&gt;
But enchant her Bucur did, leading her away to the sound of his flute. But Bucur was never again seen after he led her away.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened to Jalomitza and Bucur? Did Bucur lead pretty Jalomita to his cave? If he did then what happened? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read this story and find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
And, oh, the next time you&amp;rsquo;re in Bucharest, be sure to drive North on the A3 to Ploesti then continue on nation route 1 to Sinaia or Busteni. When you get there, ask for directions to the Cave of Jalomitza.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
