  <title>Jazz Off-Key - Dandi Daley Mackall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written by bestselling author Dandi Daley mackall, in this series girls use Internet technology to unite and connect in powerful new ways. Discover a world where girls come together from completely different backgrounds and beliefs to start a journey of faith and self-discovery. When Jazz gets her big break&amp;mdash;her own one-woman art show for Big Lake&amp;rsquo;s Spring Fling celebration&amp;mdash;she&amp;rsquo;s ecstatic &amp;hellip; until Kendra, her special needs sister, ruins her paintings by trying to make them happier and more colorful. Jazz discovers she can&amp;rsquo;t control her anger, and her rage at family and friends grows to the point that she recognizes the need for Christ to cover her sins and change her from the inside. DANDI DALEY MACKALL won her first writing contest when she was ten years old with fifty words on why she wanted to be a batboy. She won, but they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let a girl be a batboy. It was her first taste of rejection. She bounced back and has since published 400 books. Dandi lives in rural West Salem, OH, and enjoys her husband and kids, who will still, on occasion, be up for a game of family softball.&lt;/p&gt;" />
