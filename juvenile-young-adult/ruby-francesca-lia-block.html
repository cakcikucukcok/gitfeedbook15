  <title>Ruby - Francesca Lia Block</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the beloved author of &lt;em&gt;Necklace of Kisses&lt;/em&gt; comes a modern-day fairy tale of a willful and intuitive heroine and a world of shocking realism and transcendent magic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Lia Block, this time with co-writer Carmen Staton, introduces readers to Ruby, a Midwestern girl named for the jewel that is believed to ward off evil spirits. Ruby&#39;s special gift is a sixth sense that makes her at one with nature and gives her the ability to know her own destiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After growing up in an abusive family, Ruby escapes to Los Angeles and learns of her soulmate -- Orion -- a British actor. She travels to England, where she works at a potions and herbs shop, and through a series of coincidental circumstances, ends up nursing Orion back to health without confessing that she has been on a quest to find him all along. But just when she thinks her dream is becoming a reality, Ruby is stopped in her tracks by the violent demons of her past. Only by facing the darkness together can she and Orion finally fulfill their destiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;em&gt;Necklace of Kisses&lt;/em&gt;, Block, here with Staton, breaks the mold. In &lt;em&gt;Ruby&lt;/em&gt;, readers will find a story about the power of our minds to overcome the past and ultimately change the course of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
