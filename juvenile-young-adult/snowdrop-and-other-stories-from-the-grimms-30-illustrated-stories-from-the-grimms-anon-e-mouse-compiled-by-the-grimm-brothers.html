  <title>SNOWDROP AND OTHER STORIES FROM THE GRIMMS - 30 Illustrated stories from the Grimms - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by the Grimm Brothers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume of 30 folk and fairy tales was compiled by the Grimm Brothers over a century ago.&lt;br /&gt;
The tales are brought to life by the 20 colour plates and 28 pen and ink illustrations by the master illustrator &amp;ndash; Arthur Rackham, whose work was years ahead of his contemporaries and is more than sufficient to spark the imagination of young readers. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered where the Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s 3D augmented reality animators get their inspiration from, look no further than the works of Arthur Rackham.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the stories in this volume will be the familiar Western stock which have been around for years like The Elves And The Shoemaker, The Goose Girl (the Little Goose Girl), The Golden Goose, also known as The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg. Conversely, some tales will be totally unfamiliar and may seem like you have made a new discovery &amp;ndash; and why not, for these are only a sliver in the massive library of European folk and fairy tales. While some of the story names may seem unfamiliar, the stories may not be, for example: Ashenputtel is the German name for Cinderella, and&amp;nbsp; Briar Rose and Snowdrop were renamed Sleaping Beauty and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves respectively by Disney in the late 1930&amp;rsquo;s and the names has been with us ever since.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But don&amp;rsquo;t expected these stories to be the modern sanitised versions which flicker across the silver screen. These are the originals which were designed to equip children with morals and to teach them the lessons of life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Snowdrop&lt;br /&gt;
The Pink&lt;br /&gt;
