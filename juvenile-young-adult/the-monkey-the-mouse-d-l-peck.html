  <title>The Monkey &amp; the Mouse - D.L. Peck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Monkey and the Mouse is a lovely and lively children&#39;s story book.
This is a tale of two very best friends who live high in the top of a huge tree which hangs far out over a big river.
Come join the fun and adventures of Milford Monkey and Max Mouse.
&quot;The Monkey &amp; The Mouse&quot; is the first in the series &quot;Grammy&#39;s Wonderful Stories&quot; - Grammy is a wonderful old storyteller whose inspiration comes from the deep woods in the high mountains of every child&#39;s delightful imagination.
Grammy tells us:
I have written all my life for the little ones, my children, my grandchildren, and everyone else&#39;s children.
All of Grammy&#39;s stories teach a life lesson in a most adventurous, exciting, and fun way.
They are always written with love and care.
Anyone who has ever read my stories has loved them, no matter their age. 
They are truly stories for everyone, reminders of the magic and the good in the world.
Readers say:
Just awesome! Teaches and makes you giggle at the same time... Adorable... Four stars.
-Debra Izzo
It was overflowing with details and real-life values broken down for children... essentially one of the best children&#39;s stories I have ever read.
