  <title>The Fantastic and Terrible Fame of Classroom 13 - Honest Lee, Matthew J. Gilbert, Joëlle Dreidemy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;As heard by kids everywhere on the Echo Dot Kids Edition, the Classroom 13 books are a hilarious new chapter book series-perfect for reluctant readers and fans of Roald Dahl, Captain Underpants, and Sideways Stories from Wayside School.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;The Fantastic and Terrible Fame of Classroom 13&lt;/i&gt; is the third title in a series about the students of a very unlucky classroom. The easy-to-read chapters are full of humor, action, secret codes, and fun-and will prompt hours of conversation among friends, families, and classmates. The final chapter encourages young readers to write their own chapter and send it in to the author, Honest Lee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When famous agent Lucy LaRoux drops by Classroom 13, she makes an offer no one can refuse-she makes all of the students FAMOUS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  You might think this was sweet, but it was not. It was selfish. (Lucy wants their money.) With great fame comes frightening stage fright, broken bones, rotten reality television, and other awful accidents. As the students of Classroom 13 are about to learn, being famous (or infamous) isn&#39;t always fun." />
