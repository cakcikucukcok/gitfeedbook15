  <title>Paw Prints in the Moonlight - Denis O&#39;Connor, Richard Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A  snowy January night. A cat that beat the odds. A man whose life would  be forever changed.  This is the remarkable story of Toby Jug, the  extraordinary cat who thought he was human.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paw Prints in the Moonlight&lt;/i&gt;  is the truly special tale of one kind man and the cat that changed his  life. Set in the rural splendor of Northumberland, England, this  heartwarming and classic book will be cherished by people of all ages.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When  Denis O&#39;Connor rescues a three-week-old kitten from certain death  during a snowstorm, little does he know how this tiny creature will  change his life forever. Against all odds the kitten-whom he names Toby  Jug-survives and turns out to be a wondrous Maine Coon Cat  extraordinaire. Life with Toby is never dull, and Denis and Toby embark  on a series of sometimes comical, sometimes poignant adventures that  bring them ever closer together. From the massive invasion of bees at  Owl Cottage to the mysterious case of the disappearing tomatoes, Denis  and Toby form an extraordinary bond, and the cat that no one thought  would live through the night ends up altering the lives of everyone he  meets. &lt;br&gt;With spectacular watercolor illustrations depicting Toby&#39;s  many hijinks, this timeless story about the power of pets will captivate  readers of &lt;i&gt;Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World, Marley &amp; Me: Life and Love with the World&#39;s Worst Dog, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Oogy: The Dog Only a Family Could Love. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
