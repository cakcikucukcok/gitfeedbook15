  <title>My Mother the Cheerleader - Robert Sharenow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Acts of courage come in all shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tumultuous New Orleans of 1960, thirteen-year-old Louise Collins finds her world turned upside down when a stranger from the North arrives at her mother&#39;s boarding-house. Louise&#39;s mother spends her mornings at the local elementary school with a group of women known as the Cheerleaders, who harass the school&#39;s first black student, six-year-old Ruby Bridges, as she enters the building. One day a Chevy Bel Air with a New York license plate pulls up, and out steps Morgan Miller, a man whose mysterious past is eclipsed by his intellect and open-manner&amp;#8212;qualities that enchant mother and daughter alike. For the first time, Louise feels as if someone cares what she thinks, even if she doesn&#39;t know what she believes. But when the reason for Morgan&#39;s visit is called into question, everything Louise thinks she knows about her mother, her world, and herself will change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
