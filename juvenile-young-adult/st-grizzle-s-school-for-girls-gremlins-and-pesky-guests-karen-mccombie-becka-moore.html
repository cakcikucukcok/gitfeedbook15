  <title>St Grizzle’s School for Girls, Gremlins and Pesky Guests - Karen Mccombie, Becka Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a flood closes the village school, Lulu invites the staff and pupils to come and join them at St Grizzle’s. Dani and her friends can’t believe their bad luck – it was awful enough bumping into Spencer and his cronies in the village but now they’ve got to share classrooms and lessons with them. Before long pupils are clashing with pupils, there are pranks aplenty and even the teachers aren’t getting along. Keen to create a happier environment Lulu comes up with the idea of putting on a show, but with tempers fraying it’s soon looking like a big failure. Determined that the show will go on, Lulu calls on Dani and co, as the oldest children in the school, to set a good example and make friends. But with Spencer up to his usual tricks, can the two rival groups put aside their differences long enough to turn a disaster into a triumph? &lt;br&gt;This warm, funny series based in the maddest of mad boarding schools, is perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;SCARLET AND IVY&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A MURDER MOST UNLADYLIKE&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;“Fizzing with mayhem” – Sally Morris, &lt;i&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
