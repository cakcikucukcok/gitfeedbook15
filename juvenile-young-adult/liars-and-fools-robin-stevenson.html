  <title>Liars and Fools - Robin Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fiona&#39;s life changed forever when her mother died in a South Pacific sailing accident. One year later, everyone tells her it is time to move on. To Fiona, moving on means leaving her mother behind-something she has vowed never to do. But Fiona&#39;s father has started dating again. His new girlfriend, Kathy, is a professional psychic who claims she can predict the future and communicate with the dead. Fiona is sure she is a fraud, although she secretly longs for her abilities to be genuine. With the reluctant support of her best friend Abby, Fiona sets out to put an end to her father&#39;s new relationship by trying to prove, with decidedly mixed results, that Kathy is a liar." />
