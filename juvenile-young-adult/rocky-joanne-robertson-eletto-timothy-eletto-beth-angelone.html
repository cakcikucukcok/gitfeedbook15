  <title>Rocky - Joanne Robertson-Eletto, Timothy Eletto, Beth Angelone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rocky Raccoon loves living on a golf course. Morning is his favorite time because that is when the treasures hidden in his nest at the top of a tall palm tree shine their brightest. But Rocky is not satisfied with the soda cans, shiny food wrappers, and coins he has already collected. There is one flashy prize he is dying to own, but he knows he cannot do it alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of Henrietta Hawk, Rocky finally manages to snatch Billionaire Bills cell phone for his collection. But it is not long before he learns the valuable lesson that he should be more careful what he wishes for in life. As he attempts to make friends with the talking and squawking phone he now calls Cheery, Rocky must carefully dodge Gary Gators and Ranger Ricks attempts to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this charming childrens tale inspired by a real-life event on a golf course in southern Florida, a raccoon obsessed with shiny objects discovers that the one thing he wants comes with more challenges than he ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
