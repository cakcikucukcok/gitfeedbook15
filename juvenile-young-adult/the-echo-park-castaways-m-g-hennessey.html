For over a year they&amp;#8217;ve been staying with Mrs. K in Echo Park. Vic spends most of his time living in a dream world, Mara barely speaks, and Nevaeh is forced to act as a back-up parent. Though their situation isn&amp;#8217;t ideal, it&amp;#8217;s still their best home yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Child Protective Services places Quentin in the house, and everything is turned upside down. Nevaeh really can&amp;#8217;t handle watching over anyone else, especially a boy on the autism spectrum.

It could result in the foster siblings getting sent to different group homes. But isn&amp;#8217;t family always worth the risk?&lt;/p&gt;" />
