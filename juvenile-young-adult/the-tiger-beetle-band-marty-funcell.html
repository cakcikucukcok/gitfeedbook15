&lt;p&gt;John the tiger beetle and his friend Paul were enjoying an afternoon out. But life changed for both when they heard music coming from a concert. Author Marty Funcells The Tiger Beetle Band: Good Vibrations is the story of an accident turned into a career choice. When John lets his curiosity get the best of him, he falls into a guitar. At first, hes frightened and worried what could happen. Its loud inside that guitar! But after a while, he starts to like the musica lot. So much so that he decides to form a band with Paul, Bingo, and George. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tiger Beetle Band: Good Vibrations is a fun story that touches on many things children enjoy. Or would like if they had the chance. After all, the guitar was being played by one of the Beach Boys, a groundbreaking rock band. And who wouldnt like to have their own bands? It also shows that even scary things can lead to fun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
