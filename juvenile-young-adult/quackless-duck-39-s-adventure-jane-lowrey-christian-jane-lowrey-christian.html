  <title>Quackless Duck&#39;s Adventure - Jane Lowrey-Christian, Jane Lowrey-Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Quackless Duck is fortunate to be living a life of comfort in a bathtub, as a rubber duck, who has two little bear pals for his friends. Quackless is washed away in a flood, and rescued by a lovable little dog named Bailey who takes him home with her. But Quackless gets homesick for his pals and talks Bailey into taking him to find them. From that point, Quackless is visited by his dream angel several times and with each visit his life changes.  He learns how to adjust to each problem he encounters and learns how to solve his own problems.  He makes many new friends, and learns to love his enemies.  
The inspiration for this story of Quackless started with a Yard Duck that was equipped with a sensor, and could quack when someone or something passed by, but lost this ability with time and age.  {It is also available in a series of seven books that are fully illustrated in full color by the Author, for small Children. Xlibris 1-888-795-4274}" />
