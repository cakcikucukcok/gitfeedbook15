  <title>Little Bad Tyrone - Amy L. Deanes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amy was born in West Point, MS on February 5, 1977, to Shelton and Frances Deanes. 
Raised in a large family with four sisters and three brothers, she is next to the oldest child. She began writing at an early age. Her first writings were raps, because of her desire to become a rapper and a singer. 
Growing up as a teenager, she was very sheltered with many limitations on her coming and goings, this frustrated her and led her to write many short stories. 
Later, after graduation she went to a community college, where she became pregnant during her first semester. Eight months into her pregnancy she met her husband, Charles Wayne Henley and later had a wonderful son, Treasure Playa Stegall. 
She now writes children stories, inspirational/religious stories and Adult erotic stories. Her writings no matter which genre can be seen and felt through each line." />
