Not new like from New York City new&amp;#8212;or even Kansas new. New like from India new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the U.S., she has it all wrong: the way she dresses, the way she talks, the way she wears her hair. And then there is the ring, which makes her way different from everyone else&amp;#8212;because Shalini has been engaged since she was three to Vikram, back in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shalini&amp;#8217;s life has been turned upside down. She doesn&amp;#8217;t fit in, her mom is depressed, and email is no substitute for being with Vikram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she meets Toby at school, Shalini&amp;#8217;s heart gets turned upside down, too. Just looking at Toby makes her stomach flutter. She thinks she loves Vikram, but he never made her feel like this.&lt;/p&gt;" />
