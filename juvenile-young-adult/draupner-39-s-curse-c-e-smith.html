  <title>Draupner&#39;s Curse - C. E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When fifteen-year-old Kyle Dunlop discovers two gold coins near the entrance to a seaside cave, he can hardly wait to look inside to find the rest of the treasure. However, instead of unearthing a pirates hoard, Kyle and his three friends stumble upon a secret, subterranean world inhabited by goblins, elves, trolls, and other fantastic creatures.&lt;p&gt; 
As strangers in this unusual world, Kyle and his companions are detained by goblins until they are able to convince the Goblin King that their intentions are honorable. With his suspicions allayed, the king holds a feast for his guests and, afterwards, he presents Kyle with a gift and a golden opportunity. Seemingly overcome by greed, Kyle exchanges one like gift for another and unwittingly unleashes a curse that sends him on a perilous journey. Its a race against time and Kyle has to either break the curse or die. 
Join Kyle and his companions as they come face to face with a carnivorous razorback, encounter gigantic, man-eating spiders, battle a sea serpent, play havoc with an army of invading giants, and flee from an angry, fire-breathing dragonall intent on stopping them from reaching Darkalfheim in time." />
