  <title>The Small Window - Linda Teigland Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Thorald homestead was located near the banks of St. Peters River in the southern portion of Wisconsin Territory. One day this region would become part of the great state of Minnesota; the river would be renamed the Minnesota River; and near the old homestead, a city would rise and identify itself after Chief Mankato of the Mdewakanton Sioux. 
Pa and the twins worked hard to turn that rich black earth into life and subsistence for his wife and five younguns. When the unpredictable weather fought his labor and sweat and the land turned against him, survival rose to new heights. And Pa caught the dream of the new land 
It was 1848. Pa followed his dream; he was taking his family to the Promised Land, a land called California  
Pa taught his family that God will not shut a door without opening a window. He said it was Gods Way of leading His Children. And during these hard times, Pa added that it was the North wind that made the Vikings.
What he didnt tell Laurin, his 17 year-old-daughter, was how small and difficult getting through that window might be or how long and strong that North wind might blow 
Laurin, like her father, dreamed big  
...until tragedy struck! 
When cholera claimed the lives of her parents and older brothers in the Humboldt Sink, she had to find that window  set her own sail against that staunch wind  
Only she remained to do it!
She had to find a way not just to survive the trek over the Sierra and into California, but to survive and be safe, once they arrived in this untamed land dominated by men, gold, and greed. It wasnt for herself but for her younger brother, age 7, and sister, age 4. They were her responsibility  their future; their very lives depended upon her. They couldnt go back; there was no back!
She loved them  she had to find a way  
Join Laurin as she transforms into Hardluck Lin and becomes a part of the early history of the California Gold Rush." />
