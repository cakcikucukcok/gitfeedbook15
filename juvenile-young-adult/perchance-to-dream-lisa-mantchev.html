She knew the Players and their parts, but she didn&#39;t know that she, too, had magic. Now, she is the Mistress of Revels, the Teller of Tales, and determined to follow her stars. She is ready for the outside world. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Enter BERTIE AND COMPANY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the outside world soon proves more topsy-turvy than any stage production. Bertie can make things happen by writing them, but outside the protective walls of the Thèâtre, nothing goes as planned. And her magic cannot help her make a decision between--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nate: &lt;/b&gt;Her suave and swashbuckling pirate, now in mortal peril. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ariel: &lt;/b&gt;A brooding, yet seductive, air spirit whose true motives remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Nate is kidnapped and taken prisoner by the Sea Goddess, only Bertie can free him. She and her fairy sidekicks embark on a journey aboard the Thèâtre&#39;s caravan, using Bertie&#39;s word magic to guide them. Along the way, they collect a sneak-thief, who has in his possession something most valuable, and meet The Mysterious Stranger, Bertie&#39;s father--and the creator of the scrimshaw medallion. Bertie&#39;s dreams are haunted by Nate, whose love for Bertie is keeping him alive, but in the daytime, it&#39;s Ariel who is tantalizingly close, and the one she is falling for. Who does Bertie love the most? And will her magic be powerful enough to save her once she enters the Sea Goddess&#39;s lair?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once again, LISA MANTCHEV has spun a tale like no other--full of romance, magic, adventure, and fairies, too--that readers won&#39;t want to put down, even after the curtain has closed.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Dialogue is witty and sharp, and she ach My review for Eyes Like Stars , the precursor to Perchance To Dream , was brief, flighty, and not a true approximation of how I feel about this series.<br /><b><i>Perchance to Dream (Théâtre Illuminata, #2) by Lisa Mantchev</i></b> | Lisa Mantchev is the author of the Theatre Illuminata series, including Perchance to Dream and Eyes Like Stars.
