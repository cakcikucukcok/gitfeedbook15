      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving, wholly involving, original, and emotionally true, &lt;i&gt;You Don&#39;t Know Me&lt;/i&gt; is a multilayered young adult novel that presents a winning portrait of an understandably angst-ridden adolescent. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John (&quot;My father named me after a toilet!&quot;) wrestles with the certainty that no one really knows him -- not in his miserable home, and certainly not at school. It&#39;s true that no one can guess his hidden thoughts, which are hilarious, razor-sharp observations about lust, love, tubas, algebra, everything. And then there&#39;s his home: his father ran off years ago, so he&#39;s being raised by his mother, who works long hours, and by her boyfriend, whom John calls &quot;the man who is not and never will be my father.&quot; This man is his enemy, an abusive disciplinarian who seems to want to kill John and, in a horrible final confrontation, nearly succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
