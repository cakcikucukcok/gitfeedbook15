  <title>The Butterfly&#39;s Great Idea - Rosemarie Febles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout my twenty years as a teacher, I consider creativity and imagination to be important parts of a childs overall developmental process. I always encourage and motivate my students by asking a simple question: Using your own imagination, who has a story they want to tell all of us? As soon as I pose the question, you can see their eyes sparkle, little faces with look of joy, and just cannot wait to begin to tell their story. I truly enjoy watching them smile, giggle, and just having fun telling their story. 
I believe that a teacher should always be a positive role model. Thats why the illustrations on my book are designed to encourage children to use their imaginations and create their own ideas and life visions. 
This book is intended to be more than a fun story (which it is!). It also touches on many life lessons beginning with the idea that life comes with many choices. One of those choices can be to see life as full of joy and wonderful accomplishments. 
Even though its sometimes a struggle to make a really good choice, there are great rewards that can be reaped, regardless of the journey. Perhaps most importantly, my story teaches children to never give up on themselves, their hopes, their ideas, or their dreams." />
