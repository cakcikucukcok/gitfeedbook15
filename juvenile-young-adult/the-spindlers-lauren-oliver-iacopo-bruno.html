  <title>The Spindlers - Lauren Oliver, Iacopo Bruno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Evocative of &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;, this novel from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Lauren Oliver is a bewitching story about the reaches of loyalty and the enduring power of hope. Perfect for fans of the author&amp;#8217;s other middle grade novels: &lt;em&gt;Liesl &amp;#38; Po&lt;/em&gt; and the Curiosity House series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking across the breakfast table one morning, twelve-year-old Liza feels dread wash over her. Although her younger brother, Patrick, appears the same, Liza knows that he is actually quite different. She is certain that the spindlers&amp;#8212;evil, spiderlike beings&amp;#8212;came during the night and stole his soul. And Liza is also certain that she is the only one who can rescue him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with little more than her wits and a huge talking rat for a guide, Liza descends into the dark and ominous underground to save Patrick&#39;s soul. Her quest is far from easy: she must brave tree-snakes, the Court of Stones, and shape-shifting scawgs before facing her greatest challenge in the spindlers&#39; lair, where more than just Patrick&#39;s soul is at stake. &lt;/p&gt;" />
