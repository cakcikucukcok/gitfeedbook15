  <title>A Summer to Remember - Carolyn Swan Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For her summer break from college, Nicole Thomas is ecstatic to be in beautiful Estes Park, Colorado. Family friends Virginia and Norman Parker own a resort at the foothills of Rocky Mountain National Park, and Nicole helps take on the job of cottage caretaker for two and a half months with older friend, Catherine Maine.&lt;br /&gt;
Its not long before Nicole meets three handsome men who will play pivotal roles in her Colorado vacation. Forest rangers Scott Thompson, Todd Wheeler, and Bill Martin are handsome and fun to be around, but Scott is the one who captures her heart. But Scott is also in love with another girl and cant give his whole heart to Nicole. Crushed, she learns a hard lesson about the dangers of giving her heart away so quickly and resolves never to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;
Nicole tries to soothe her heart by focusing on the bounty of beauty the park offers, from stunning wildlife to majestic mountain views. As she does so, she begins to see things in a new light. Still, romance doesnt stay away, and Nicole contends with her emotions for the three men and their attentions to her. She sees Todd as only a friend despite his feelings for her, and Bill is more like an older brother than a love interest.&lt;br /&gt;
Just as Nicole is beginning to think that true love will never find her, she discovers that you should never say never.&lt;/p&gt;" />
