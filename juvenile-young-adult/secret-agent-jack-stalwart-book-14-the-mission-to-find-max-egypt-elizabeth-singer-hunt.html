  <title>Secret Agent Jack Stalwart: Book 14: The Mission to Find Max: Egypt - Elizabeth Singer Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mission to Find Max&lt;/i&gt; (Book 14) Jack joined the Global Protection Force for two reasons: to thwart evil around the world and to rescue his brother, Max, who went missing while working as a GPF agent. The GPF refused to share any details with Jack about Max&#39;s whereabouts, but on two previous missions, Jack had collected clues that pointed to Max is being in Egypt. Now Jack has reason to believe that King Tut&#39;s diadem-a crown thought to have magical powers-is the cause of Max&#39;s disappearance. The crown was so important that King Tut was buried with it on his head, but when the boy-pharaoh&#39;s tomb was opened in 1922, an assistant archaeologist named Omar Massri stole the artifact. Could a descendant of Massri somehow be involved in Max&#39;s disappearance? Jack and his old friend Kate must prevent an ancient and terrible curse of the pharaohs from wreaking havoc, or else Egypt-and Jack&#39;s brother-could be doomed.&lt;/div&gt;" />
