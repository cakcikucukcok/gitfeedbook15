After the baby comes home (it&#39;s all right), Casey and Mitch announce that the four of them - as a family - are going on vacation with Casey&#39;s family. All twenty-three of them! Ben is sure this will not be all right!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How eleven-year-old Ben finds his place in a crazy-big family makes this a funny novel about family and what it means to be a part of one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
