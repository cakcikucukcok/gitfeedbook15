He needs her ability to shift to animal form, to wind, to mist. He needs her lethal speed and superhuman strength. And he needs her loyalty&amp;#8212;because without it, she may be his greatest threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabel knows that her prince is lying to her, but she can&#39;t help wanting to protect him from the dangers and intrigues of the court . . . until a deadly truth shatters the bond between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Isabel faces a choice that threatens her loyalty, her heart . . . and everything she thought she knew.&lt;/p&gt;" />
