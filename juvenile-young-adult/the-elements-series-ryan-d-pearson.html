  <title>The Elements Series - Ryan D Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After overcoming the loss of his Parents and Grandfather, discovering the true relationship between his cousin and himself, as well as stopping the Seven Deadly Sins from raising hell; what else could there be in store for Reagan Jameson?
There is still a couple of weeks left before finals are over and school will be finished. The Elements have moved in together and Oracle City seems safe from harm. However, in addition to the worry of Crystallics return, the fashion line doing well and approaching Eli about dating Izzy, Reagan must consider if he will actually graduate from high school.
Though graduating will be the least of his concerns when he finds himself amidst a scandal involving another socialite, discovering the identity and intentions of Oracle Citys new superhero and confronting the first person to discover the true identities of the Elements. Being a regular teenager, whilst the worlds pressures rest on his shoulders, will be that much harder when he is looking over his shoulder in fear of Crystallic, rogue vigilantes and the paparazzi.
With more twists and turns than Green Hope, Spirited Vigilante promises to keep you guessing until the final chapter. Filled with more family secrets, a more complex web of relationships, more powers and more drama, Spirited Vigilante will have you questioning who is truly worthy of being part of the Elements." />
