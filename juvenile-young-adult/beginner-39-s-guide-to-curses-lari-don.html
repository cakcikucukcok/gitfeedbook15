  <title>Beginner&#39;s Guide to Curses - Lari Don</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Molly Drummond is cursed: whenever a dog barks, she turns into a hare -- which can make life quite dangerous... So she does the sensible thing and attends a curse-lifting workshop, run by a local witch. There she meets other cursed creatures: Innes, a kelpie; Beth, a dryad; Atacama, a sphinx; and a toad. But should they work together to lift their various curses? Or are they better off on their own? And will the crow-man, who draws on the energy of curses, destroy their chances to live a normal life? 
By the author of the bestselling Fabled Beasts Chronicles series, this is the dramatic first installment in the brand new, long-awaited Spellchasers trilogy. Lari Don has once again created a world of brilliant magic, dark danger and sparkling friendship which will enchant children of upper primary age. 
The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Curses will be followed in spring 2017 by The Shapeshifter&#39;s Guide to Running Away (book 2) and The Witch&#39;s Guide to Magical Combat (book 3) in autumn 2017. Publication will be supported by a major marketing and promotion campaign with Lari, across Scotland and the rest of the UK." />
