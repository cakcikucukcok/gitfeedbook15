  <title>The Equals - Daniel Sweren-Becker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens when your own government turns against you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Equality Team continues to round up and subject The Ones--the 1% of the American population who were genetically engineered in vitro--to a vaccine that will level the playing field. Desperate to save her boyfriend James from this fate, Cody flees into the wild to seek assistance from a shadowy rebel group dedicated to equal rights for the Ones at any cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she grows closer to  a radical named Kai, she&#39;s brought deeper into the fold, only to realize the group&#39;s  leader has a secret plan more dangerous than Cody could have  imagined--something that could change the course of the Ones&#39; future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Themes of justice, discrimination  and terrorism mix with actual science to create a frightening version of our near future in Daniel Sweren-Becker&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Equals,&lt;/i&gt; the action-packed sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Ones&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Imprint Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Chilling and frighteningly real&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Ones&lt;/i&gt; leads us down a dark rabbit hole of scientific possibilities, fractured morality, and brutal consequences. It forces the question: If perfection becomes a liability, how far are we willing to go in the pursuit of it -- or to stop it?&quot;--Kami Garcia, #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling coauthor of &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Creatures&lt;/i&gt; and author of&lt;i&gt;The Lovely Reckless&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Like watching your favorite TV show, &lt;i&gt;The Ones&lt;/i&gt; is a thrill ride with a new shock at every turn&lt;/b&gt;. You won&#39;t believe what happens next, and yet, you should. Because this reality is all too possible.&quot; --Melissa de la Cruz, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Isle of the Lost &lt;/i&gt;and the forthcoming &lt;i&gt;Something In Between&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A gripping and cautionary tale. &lt;b&gt;A thrilling read&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; --Brendan Reichs, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling coauthor of the Virals series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;The basic premise for this captivating tale is much closer to practical concern than many might imagine&lt;/b&gt;. It is crucial that we visualize many possible scenarios like this one so that we can humanely respond to (or better yet anticipate) new technologies and the consequences for new babies. We hopefully will not punish the latter for the shortcomings of the former, and books like this will help us all engage with the key issues, technical and moral.&quot; --George Church, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and author of &lt;i&gt;Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
