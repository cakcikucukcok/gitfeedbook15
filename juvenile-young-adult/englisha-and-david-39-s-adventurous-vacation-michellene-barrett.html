  <title>Englisha and David&#39;s Adventurous Vacation - Michellene Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Englisha Regents thinks David Henriquez is the hottest guy in school. He is cute, has shiny black hair, and speaks fluent Spanish: all qualities that make a perfect boyfriend in her eyes. When she finally captures his attention and invites him to her sweet sixteen birthday party, Englisha has no idea that a grand adventure waits for both of them.
After David arrives at her party, Englisha is ecstatic when he holds her close while dancing. When her mother makes a surprising announcement that she has helped arrange a weeklong vacation in Los Angeles for the couple, Englisha ignores warnings from her jealous friend, Laurenthina, and leaves the next day with David. Anxious to prove their maturity to their parents, David and Englisha arrive in Los Angeles with high hopes. But when a series of unfortunate events begin to cloud their happiness, the teens soon realize the value of love, forgiveness, and living each day to the fullest.
Englisha and Davids Adventurous Vacation is the story of two teens as they embark on a journey of independence and self-discovery and learn valuable life lessons." />
