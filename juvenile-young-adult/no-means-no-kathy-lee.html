  <title>No Means No - Kathy Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s rubbish being the vicar&#39;s daughter. Everyone expects to act a certain way, dress in certain clothes and never do anything wrong, especially your mum. But what happens when you couldn&#39;t care less about what the old biddies at church think? What happens when parties, boyfriends and even fame come knocking at your door? You ignore what your mum and dad, and God, say and you go for it, that&#39;s what. But when Emma abandons all that she has grown up with and things start to go wrong, it seems like no one can help her…
Emma is fed up of being the &#39;good vicar&#39;s daughter&#39; and wants to live her own life, but in abandoning all that she has known, she ends up losing a lot more. This fictional story for 11 to 14s alludes to the parable of the Lost Son as it helps young people examine their own relationship with God and how they can learn to love and live God&#39;s way." />
