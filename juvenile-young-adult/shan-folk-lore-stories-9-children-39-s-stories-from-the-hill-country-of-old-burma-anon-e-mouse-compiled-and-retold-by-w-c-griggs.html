  <title>SHAN FOLK LORE STORIES - 9 Children&#39;s Stories from the Hill Country of Old Burma - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Retold by W C Griggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These stories have been taken from the great mass of unwritten lore that is to the boys and girls of the Shan mountain country of Burma what &amp;quot;Rapunzel&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;Snow White&amp;rdquo; and &amp;quot;Cinderella&amp;quot; are to Western children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find 9 illustrated Shan stories like, How Boh Han Me Got His Title, Story Of The Princess Nang Kam Ung, How The Hare Deceived The Tiger, How The World Was Created, How The King Of Pagan Caught The Thief and more.&lt;br /&gt;
In Shan folk-lore the hero does not &amp;quot;marry and live happy ever after,&amp;quot; but he becomes the king of the country, which, we guess, is a pretty good substitute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These stories are purely native, with as little mixture of Western ideas as possible, while dressing them in their garment of English words. They will give a better insight into what the Burmese natives are. As such, our hope is they will be found to be more interesting to children and the avid folklorist alike.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A percentage of the net profit from the sale of this book will be donated to the Phaung Daw Oo Monastic Education High School, Mandalay, Myanmar.&lt;br /&gt;
