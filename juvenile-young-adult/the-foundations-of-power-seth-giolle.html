  <title>The Foundations of Power - Seth Giolle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Kings and their nobles; the Hawk and his rebellion; and Keiritte Alo and his Alo soldiers work feverishly to create a strong position for the battle to come that will decide the fate of the Valley of Nieve Alo and everyone living in it. While they toil at their labours, there is ever an unseen hand working in the shadowy background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaving his spells and manipulating the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the puppets struggle to gain power. Let them think themselves strong. Let some throw themselves in his way to try and stop his every measure. He is growing invulnerable to any act of will or stubborn bravado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were they ever a threat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third sword resists bonding with its chosen wielder out of time, but the Watcher has waited long enough. Goelldn-Auk, Bvorntwenn, DiJennai - the Three Swords of the Legacy of Auk Tria Yus will be claimed and united. When that time comes, his Volgath will be exacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is very real.&lt;/p&gt;" />
