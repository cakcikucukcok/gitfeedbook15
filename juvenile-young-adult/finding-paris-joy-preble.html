  <title>Finding Paris - Joy Preble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An evocative and compelling story of two sisters who would do anything for each other&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt;. Joy Preble&#39;s stirring new novel explores the lengths to which sisters go to protect each other, and the winding road that brings two strangers into each other&#39;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisters Leo and Paris Hollings have only ever had each other to rely on. They can&#39;t trust their mother, who hops from city to city and from guy to guy, or their gambler stepfather, who&#39;s moved them all to Las Vegas. It&#39;s just the two of them: Paris, who&#39;s always been the dreamer, and Leo, who has a real future in mind&amp;#8212;going to Stanford, becoming a doctor, falling in love. But Leo isn&#39;t going anywhere right now, except driving around Vegas all night with her sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Paris ditches Leo at the Heartbreak Hotel Diner, where moments before they had been talking with physics student Max Sullivan. Outside, Leo finds a cryptic note from Paris&amp;#8212;a clue. Is it some kind of game? Where is Paris, and why has she disappeared? When Leo reluctantly accepts Max&#39;s offer of help, the two find themselves following a string of clues through Vegas and beyond. But the search for the truth is not a straight line. And neither is the path to secrets Leo and Max hold inside.&lt;/p&gt;" />
