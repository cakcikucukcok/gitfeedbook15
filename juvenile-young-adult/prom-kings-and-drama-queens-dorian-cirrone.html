  <title>Prom Kings and Drama Queens - Dorian Cirrone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;That summer, Hurricane Emily was in the news. The headlines shouted things like: &quot;Emily Rocks South Florida.&quot; I wanted to be like that Emily in the headlines. I wanted to take the world by storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that I wanted to knock over mango trees or whip power lines across the sky like spaghetti. But I wanted to rock in my own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Bennet has some impossible projects on her &quot;To Do&quot; list, like landing her longtime crush, Brian Harrington, and winning the job of editor in chief of the school newspaper over her arch nemesis, Daniel Cummings. And, on top of that, she&#39;s determined to do something special. Something important. Something good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Emily&#39;s checking things off her list left and right. She&#39;s kissing Brian on a semiregular basis and she&#39;s raising money for a good cause by planning an Alternative Prom (but she would secretly rather go to the real one). The only item that remains is knocking Daniel Cummings off his pedestal. But when did he start to look, well, cute?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily&#39;s finding it harder and harder to stick to her list. And she still needs to conquer the most important item of all. Can she find her inner prom queen and figure out how to rock?&lt;/p&gt;" />
