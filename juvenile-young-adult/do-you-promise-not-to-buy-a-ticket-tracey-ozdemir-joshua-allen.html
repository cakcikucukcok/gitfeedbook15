  <title>Do You Promise Not to Buy a Ticket? - Tracey Ozdemir, Joshua Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This much-needed book for young children tells of the plight of captive dolphins. I hope to reach their innocence and love of animals. This book is about the atrocities that a beautiful mammal goes through as he is captured and ends his journey in concrete tank to be used peoples entertainment and greed. Many children dream about swimming with a captive dolphin, but what if they knew the truth? This book tells the true story in a child-friendly way of how dolphins become imprisoned and suffer until their dying day. This story makes children aware that all animals have a right to freedom and educates them about the natural behaviour of a wild animal compared to the behaviour of a captive. 
We must learn to love and respect our oceans and all those that live in them. Many animals are endangered, soon to become extinct. Our children are the planets future. The way to end most of the atrocities is simple: for children to take the pledge to never buy a ticket to a dolphin show." />
