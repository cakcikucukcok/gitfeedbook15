  <title>TWO ANANSI STORIES - Two more Children&#39;s Stories from Anansi the Trickster Spider - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 07&lt;br /&gt;
In this 7th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates - &amp;quot;Two Anasi Tales&amp;rdquo;. The two tales in this book are &amp;ldquo;Why the Jack Spaniard&amp;rsquo;s Waist is Small&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The King And The Ant&amp;#39;s Tree.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago and far, far away Africa, Anansi, the trickster spider and Umiyane (Um-i-ya-neh) the Mosquito were talking together, and boasting of their fathers&amp;#39; crops. The boasts became so large and absurd that the Jack Spaniard (the paper wasp) couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop laughing. Then what happened?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In our second story, there was a King who had a very beautiful daughter. He said whoever would cut down an ant&amp;#39;s tree, which he had in his kingdom, without brushing off the ants, will be given in marriage to his daughter. Did Anansi the trickster spider win the challenge? If he did, how did he go about it? Did he trick the King and his officials?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE BABA INDABA STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - all places can be found using Google maps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In looking up these place names using Google Maps, it is our hope that young people will click on the images and do further investigations about the people who live in these towns in order to gain an understanding of the many and varied cultures from around the world. Through such an exercise, it is also our hope that young people will not only increase their knowledge of world geography but also increase their appreciation and tolerance of other peoples and cultures.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
