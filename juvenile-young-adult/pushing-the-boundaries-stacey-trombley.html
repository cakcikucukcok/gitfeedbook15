  <title>Pushing the Boundaries - Stacey Trombley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Myra goes to Haiti with one goal: take the photograph that will win a scholarship and prove to her uber-traditional family that she has what it takes to be a photographer instead of a doctor. Her camera has always been her shield against getting too close to anyone, but she didn&#39;t expect the hot teen translator who has an ability to see past her walls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elias needs his job as a translator to provide for his siblings. He can&#39;t afford to break the rule forbidding him from socializing with a client. Except this girl Myra insists on going outside the city to capture the perfect picture, and he steps in as her guide in order to keep her safe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deeper they travel into the country, the harder they fall for each other. Now they&#39;re both taking risks that could cost each other their dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they get too close--it could ruin both their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: Caution! Reading this book will open your heart and inspire you to take risks. Only those searching for true love should proceed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
