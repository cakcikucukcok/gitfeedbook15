  <title>Our First Blizzard Snowman - Lucille Velotta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its January, and the snow is coming down hard. Young Vin and Ray have their fingers crossed, and soon, their wish comes true: school is canceled! Its their very first snow day! What better to do than go outside and build the perfect blizzard snowman? Little do the boys know, a lot of work goes into building a magical man out of snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they have to get dressed, and oh, what a pain when they just want to get outside. Once theyre nice and cozy, in mittens, hats, and scarves, theyre finally ready to brave the blizzard. They find an enchanted world of white and get to work on their snowman, but theyre going to need help from someone very special to build the bottom, belly, and top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours of hard work and laughter, their snowman is complete. Vin and Ray dance around him and show him off to the whole neighborhood. It seems the entire street is under the wondrous spell of a snow day, and the boys couldnt be more pleased by their snowman, who watches the revelries with a smile on his frozen face.&lt;/p&gt;Undo" />
