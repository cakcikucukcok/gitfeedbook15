  <title>Invisible Things - Jenny Davidson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sixteen-year-old Sophie knows there is more to the story of her parents&#39; death. And she&#39;s on a mission to find the truth. To aid her in solving the decades-old mystery, Sophie has enlisted her best friend, Mikael, whose friendship has turned into something more. It&#39;s soon clear that Sophie&#39;s future is very much wrapped up in the details of her family&#39;s past, and the key lies with information only one man can provide: her parents&#39; former employer, the elusive billionaire Alfred Nobel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the threat of war looms in Europe, dangers to Sophie and her loved ones grow. While her determination to solve the mystery doesn&#39;t waver, forces beyond her control conspire to keep her from her purpose. Then, news of her great-aunt Tabitha&#39;s death sets off a chain of events that leaves Sophie questioning everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more Sophie learns, the more she realizes that nothing&amp;#8212;and no one&amp;#8212;in her life is what it seems. And coming to terms with the dark secrets she uncovers means imagining a truth that she never dreamed possible. Full of gorgeous settings, thrilling adventure, and romance, invisible things is a novel that dares to ask, what if?&lt;/p&gt;" />
