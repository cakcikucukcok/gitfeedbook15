  <title>Bitsy&#39;s Strange Adventures - Dolores Conley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot; Bitsy&#39;s Strange Adventures&quot; comprises the second and third stories of the Bitsy series. The first is &quot;Bitsy and Big Leaf&quot; published in November of 2011. The story unfolds as Bitsy is carried by the blustery winter wind and lands near a maple leaf. It is important for Bitsy to know his new acquaintences names. Bitsy eventually becomes a close friend to Miss Maple as they spend the rest of winter and early spring under a fir tree. Something happens to Miss Maple but Bitsy is picked up by Cassie who in the first book watched Bitsy grow. He learns about Cassie&#39;s school underneath her desk. Cassie looses Bisty as a strong wind blows him from her hand and the third story follows where Bitsy is blown into the lobby of a hotel. He meets another character, Mr. Oak Leafroy. Eventually the two have an adventure floating down a stream. Bitsy falls through a drain but Mr. Oak leafroy becomes stuck. Bitsy is attacked by a rat and is caught in the web of a spider and some friendly bugs. A strange thing occurs as Bitsy and the Bugs are freed from the web. Bitsy saves the bugs, &quot;Nitty&quot; and &quot;Lady&quot; but when they land on a fallen log Bitsy again has to say good bye and is carried off and lands back at the old Apple grove.  Yes, and exciting event takes place at the end." />
