  <title>Neighborhood Girls - Jessie Ann Foley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A powerful coming-of-age story about a girl whose encounters with loss, broken friendships, and newfound faith leave her forever changed, from Printz Honor winner and Morris Award Finalist Jessie Ann Foley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When Wendy Boychuck&amp;#8217;s father, a Chicago cop, was escorted from their property in handcuffs, she knew her life would never be the same. Her father gets a years-long jail sentence, her family falls on hard times, and the whispers around their neighborhood are impossible to ignore. If that wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough, she gets jumped walking home from a party one night. Wendy quickly realizes that in order to survive her father&amp;#8217;s reputation, she&amp;#8217;ll have to make one for herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Wendy meets Kenzie Quintana&amp;#8212;a foul-mouthed, Catholic uniform-skirt-hiking alpha&amp;#8212;and she knows immediately that she&amp;#8217;s found her savior. Kenzie can provide Wendy with the kind of armor a girl needs when she&amp;#8217;s trying to outrun her father&amp;#8217;s past. Add two more mean girls to the mix&amp;#8212;Sapphire and Emily&amp;#8212;and Wendy has found herself in Academy of the Sacred Heart&amp;#8217;s most feared and revered clique. Makeover complete. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But complete is far from what Wendy feels. Instead, she faces the highs and lows of a toxic friendship, the exhaustion that comes with keeping up appearances, and a shattering loss&amp;#8212;the only one that could hurt more than losing herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
