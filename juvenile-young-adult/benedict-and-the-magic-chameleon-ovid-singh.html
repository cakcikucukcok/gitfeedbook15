  <title>Benedict and the Magic Chameleon - Ovid Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether a Chameleon possesses the magic to make other people have its own very ability to camouflage is not known. The Chameleon is a slow but a patient animal who take it&#39;s time to attack its prey. While a little boy, Benedict followed a butterfly that suddenly landed within his reach, but on trying to catch it, the butterfly flew away. The little boy&#39;s curiosity led him to a Chameleon, wrapped up in its own thoughts. The Chameleon spat in the boy&#39;s eyes and as the soothsayer said, the Chameleon had to die, for the boy to survive. Benedict acquired the Chameleons abilities to change color, but in his eyes. Other boys noticed a big change in Benedict&#39;s eyes after he got better from sickness, but the soothsayer cautioned him that as long as he did not reveal the magic, the spell would stay with him. The eye doctor on his examination could not find anything wrong with the boy&#39;s eyes, except he found them unique and special." />
