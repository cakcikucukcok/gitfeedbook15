&lt;p&gt;The shadow was moving behind the curtain again, wafting here and there. It looked so human, like someone was standing on the other side of the glass. Lord, I am afraid. Maybe it is nothing, but I cant sleep. Im too afraid to look for myself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Respond to Godwhen He is speaking to you:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Back outside he picked up the gas pump handle and started filling up the car. Then he heard it: Thats the one. Tell her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release to the Lord those secrets that haunt you:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Selena had kept her secret for many yearsThere were days when she wanted to confide in her close friends but fear of their judgment kept her silent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
