      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Filey is known as &amp;lsquo;The Unspoilt Hidden Gem of The Yorkshire Coast&amp;rsquo; with its glorious wide golden beach, elegant Victorian houses and well-kept gardens, but what were Filey&amp;rsquo;s origins? Unlike the neighbouring town of Scarborough, Filey was mentioned in the Domesday Book &amp;lsquo;as a very small village occupied by less than fifty people, and that Filey was worth a reasonable income, with access to good quality timber which was ideal for construction.&amp;rsquo; So, were these people Filey&amp;rsquo;s oldest residents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filey a History of The Town and its People,&lt;/em&gt; traces the history of the town from Roman times through time. It tells the history of the town&amp;rsquo;s churches and the influence that the Methodist had on the community. The book also warns of the dangers of the sea, and its treacherous tides, and recalls stories of many people who have lost their lives to the sea over the years. It also recalls the story of The Bonhomme Richard and its notorious Captain John Paul Jones. The book is illustrated with over one hundred and fifty photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
