  <title>Praying in the Moment - Shauna Jamieson Carty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Praying in the Moment: Reflections on the Election of President Barack Obama&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; groups reflections written between the president&#39;s election and inauguration, giving voice to Americans who experienced segregation, lynching and discrimination and thought they would never live to see the day that America would elect a black president. Eight of the reflections are told through the eyes of Americans who have experienced race relations at its worst, but have now witnessed progress beyond many of their expectations. The ninth reflection documents the experience of a young adult who attended the inauguration. The tenth gives voice to three children under age ten who express how they feel about the election of Americas first black president. All attend Second Baptist Church in Roselle, New Jersey, a historically black church that celebrated its 118th anniversary in 2008, as President Obama was being elected. Join Dinah White, Josephine Evans, G.G. Woody, Edith McIntyre, Theodore and Merlin Bragg, Joseph Thompson, Marguerite White, Marian Williams and her sister Barbara Turner, Jennifer Jones, twin siblings Jared and Jaida Baptist, and Annie Carty on a journey through American history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
