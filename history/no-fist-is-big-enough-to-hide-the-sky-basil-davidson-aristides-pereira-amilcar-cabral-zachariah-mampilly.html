  <title>No Fist Is Big Enough to Hide the Sky - Basil Davidson, Aristides Pereira, Amilcar Cabral, Zachariah Mampilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Fist Is Big Enough to Hide the Sky&lt;/i&gt; stands as a key text in the history of the eleven-year struggle against Portuguese rule in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde. Though perhaps less well known than the struggles in Angola and Mozambique, the liberation war waged by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) easily ranks alongside those conflicts as an example of an African independence movement triumphing against overwhelming odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basil Davidson, a leading authority on Portuguese Africa who witnessed many of these events first hand, draws on his own extensive experience in the country as well as the PAIGC archives to provide a detailed and rigorous analysis of the conflict. The book also provides one of the earliest accounts of the assassination of the PAIGC’s founder, Amilcar Cabral, and documents the movement’s remarkable success in recovering from the death of its leader and in eventually attaining independence. Featuring a preface by Cape Verde’s first president, Aristides Pereira, and a foreword by Cabral himself, &lt;i&gt;No Fist is Big Enough to Hide the Sky &lt;/i&gt;remains an invaluable resource for the study both of the region and of African liberation struggles as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;" />
