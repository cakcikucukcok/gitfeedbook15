  <title>Incarnations - Sunil Khilnani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An entertaining and provocative account of India&#39;s past, written by one of the country&#39;s leading thinkers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all India&#39;s myths, its sea of stories and moral epics, Indian history remains a curiously unpeopled place. In &lt;i&gt;Incarnations&lt;/i&gt;, Sunil Khilnani fills that space, bringing to life fifty extraordinary men and women who changed both India and the world. Journeying across India in pursuit of their stories--visiting slum temples, ayurvedic call centers, Bollywood studios, textile mills, and Mughal fortresses--Khilnani offers trenchant portraits of emperors, warriors, philosophers, artists, iconoclasts, and entrepreneurs. Some of these historical figures are famous. Some are unjustly forgotten. And all, Khilnani convinces us, are deeply relevant today. As their rich and surprising lives take the reader through twenty-five hundred winding years of Indian and world history, Khilnani brings wit, feeling, historical rigor, and uncommon insight to dilemmas that extend from ancient times to our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encounter the Buddha not as the usual beatific icon but as a radical young social critic. We meet the ancient Sanskrit linguist who inspires computer programmers today. We hear the medieval poets, ribald and profound, who mocked rituals and caste and whose voices resonate in contemporary poetry. And we see giants of the twentieth-century Independence movement--among them Mohandas Gandhi; Ambedkar, the Untouchable lawyer turned constitution maker; and the legendary singer M. S. Subbulakshmi--not as cardboard cutouts but as complex and striving human beings. At once a provocative and sophisticated reinterpretation of India&#39;s history and an incisive commentary on its present-day conflicts and struggles, &lt;i&gt;Incarnations&lt;/i&gt; is an authoritative, sweeping, and often moving account of a nation coming into its own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
