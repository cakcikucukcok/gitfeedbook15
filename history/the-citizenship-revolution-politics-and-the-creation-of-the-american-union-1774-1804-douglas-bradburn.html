  <title>The Citizenship Revolution: Politics and the Creation of the American Union, 1774-1804 - Douglas Bradburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most Americans believe that the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 marked     the settlement of post-Revolutionary disputes over the meanings of rights, democracy, and     sovereignty in the new nation. In The Citizenship Revolution, Douglas Bradburn undercuts this     view by showing that the Union, not the Nation, was the most important product of     independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1774, everyone in British North America was a subject of King     George and Parliament. In 1776 a number of newly independent &quot;states,&quot; composed of     &quot;American citizens&quot; began cobbling together a Union to fight their former fellow     countrymen. But who was an American? What did it mean to be a &quot;citizen&quot; and not a     &quot;subject&quot;? And why did it matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradburn&#39;s stunning     reinterpretation requires us to rethink the traditional chronologies and stories of the American     Revolutionary experience. He places battles over the meaning of &quot;citizenship&quot; in law     and in politics at the center of the narrative. He shows that the new political community     ultimately discovered that it was not really a &quot;Nation,&quot; but a &quot;Union of     States&quot;-and that it was the states that set the boundaries of belonging and the very     character of rights, for citizens and everyone else. To those inclined to believe that the     ratification of the Constitution assured the importance of national authority and law in the     lives of American people, the emphasis on the significance and power of the states as the     arbiter of American rights and the character of nationhood may seem strange. But, as Bradburn     argues, state control of the ultimate meaning of American citizenship represented the first     stable outcome of the crisis of authority, allegiance, and identity that had exploded in the     American Revolution-a political settlement delicately reached in the first years of the     nineteenth century. So ended the first great phase of the American citizenship revolution: a     continuing struggle to reconcile the promise of revolutionary equality with the pressing and     sometimes competing demands of law, order, and the pursuit of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
