  <title>General History of Immigration in America - Allan Mclaughlin , Allan Mclaughlin </title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;After  the Peace of Paris in 1783, and the birth of a new nation on the  American continent, home-seekers arriving at ports of the United States  were called immigrants. Previous to the revolutionary war they were  known as colonists. The distinction is one of political allegiance. The  colonist was an immigrant who desired to make a home in the new country,  but to retain his allegiance to his native land. On the other hand, the  immigrant, in a majority of instances, expected and desired to change  his political allegiance.  &lt;br/&gt;
The many advantages offered to the  home-seeker who was brave, willing and strong, in the new United States,  attracted many thousand immigrants, and it is estimated that one  hundred and fifty thousand settled in the country between 1783 and 1810.  These early immigrants were mostly from the British Isles, with a few  Germans, French and Scandinavians. The strained relations with England  followed by the war of 1812, practically stopped immigration for several  years. During 1817, however, twenty thousand immigrants arrived in the  United States. This number was unprecedented at that time, and caused  considerable criticism of the overcrowding of immigrant ships... &lt;/span&gt;
