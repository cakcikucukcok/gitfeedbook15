  <title>From Jail to Jail - Tan Malaka, Helen Jarvis, Helen Jarvis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Jail to Jail&lt;/em&gt; is the political autobiography of a central though enigmatic figure of the Indonesian Revolution. Variously labeled a communist, Trotskyite, and nationalist, Tan Malaka managed, during the several decades of his political activity, to run afoul of nearly every political group and faction involved in the Indonesian struggle for independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Malaka was elected Chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in 1921 and barely five years later opposed the PKI-led uprising in Indonesia. He openly opposed Sukarno&amp;#8217;s support for negotiations with the Dutch, yet Sukarno issued a decree in 1963 recognizing Tan Malaka as a hero of national independence. During his several decades of political activity he spent periods of exile and hiding in nearly every country in Southeast Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;From Jail to Jail&lt;/em&gt; is one of the few known autobiographies by an Asian Marxist of the 1930&amp;#8217;s and 1940&amp;#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;" />
