  <title>An Abridged History Africa and Her People - Ruthie Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This project began as a dissertation for a Doctorate Degree but as the work progressed   it was presented to the California State Department of Education to be examined as a text in the Middle schools system.
After the third meeting of the Board the votes were against the book due to the reference of the Bible.  The work, as I quote There are too many religious quotes, remarks, and or reference.  With that in mind the project was placed in storage until a publisher could be obtained.  The work was accepted as fulfillment of studies required for the writers Doctorate Degree. 
At last looking forward to publishing of this work, the reader might consider the advance steps this nation as a people have made.  Segregation and integration though not nearly completed is far from where it was. In nineteen ninety there still remained underlying prejudice. We see less and less of the racial issues today in twenty eleven but the lingering shadows still remain.
There are sections  in this book where after looking back the writer called The Day before Yesterday and there was Just Yesterday, there is Today a look at Tomorrow and the Day After Tomorrow.
This Document is useful in encouraging by the fact of overcoming, useful in building faith by seeing how far we have come from where we came from.  Useful in showing ALL young people there is Hope, though it stager it is still Hope.  Without Hope we are men most miserable.(Bible)  Useful in telling the student dont give up, and showing them the rewards of determination, the rewards of struggles and striving.  This Document will encourage the student of any back ground to set goals to exert both effort and energy to achieve the quest of success.
For every young mind create a vision of success dont look back the goal is in front let the vision determine how far you can go.  Reach for the stars." />
