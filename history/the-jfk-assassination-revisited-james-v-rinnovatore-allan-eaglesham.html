  <title>The Jfk Assassination Revisited - James V. Rinnovatore, Allan Eaglesham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Rinnovatore and Allan Eaglesham provide proof that President Kennedys body was in the Bethesda morgue well before the motorcade from Andrews Air Force Base arrived at the entrance to Bethesda Naval Hospital carrying the bronze casket in which the body had been placed at Parkland Hospital, Dallas. The casket was empty at this time, as it had been when it was placed in a gray navy ambulance for transportation from Andrews to Bethesda. The body had been removed from the bronze casket while Lyndon Johnson was being sworn in as president before Air Force One left Love Field. The purpose of the early arrival of the body at the Bethesda morgue was to alter the wounds, which had been found to be frontal by the doctors at Parkland. The wounds had to be reversed in order to implicate a lone assassin  Lee Harvey Oswald  shooting from the Texas School Book Depository. New information is provided regarding pre-autopsy photographs and exclusion of FBI agents from the autopsy room to prevent their discovery of the body there. Also provided are analyses of the reports of the Warren Commission, the HSCA, and the ARRB, of who planned the assassination, and the case for two Oswalds.
