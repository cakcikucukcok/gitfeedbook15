  <title>Freedom&#39;s Promise - Elizabeth Regosin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emancipation and the citizenship that followed conferred upon former slaves the
    right to create family relationships that were sanctioned, recognized, and regulated by the laws
    that governed the families of all American citizens. Elizabeth Regosin explores what the
    acquisition of this legal familial status meant to former slaves, personally, socially, and
    politically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Civil War pension system offers a fascinating source of
    documentation for this study of ex-slave families in transition from slavery to freedom. Because
    the provisions made to compensate eligible Union veterans and surviving family members created a
    vast bureaucracy—pension officials required and verified extensive proof of qualification—former
    slaves were obliged to reproduce and represent the inner workings of their familial
    relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regosin reveals through both their personal histories and
    pension narratives how former slaves constructed identities as individuals and as family members
    while they negotiated the boundaries of &quot;family&quot; as defined by the pension system. The
    stories told by ex-slaves, their witnesses, and the government officials who played a role in
    the pension process all serve to provide us with a richer understanding of life for newly
    emancipated African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
