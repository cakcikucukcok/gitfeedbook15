  <title>The Naturally Good Man - Rod E. Keays</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Men inherit definitions about manhood, but many of these definitions no longer fit. A society that was once based on power, assumptions, and stereotypes is changing.
Few people take time to learn about the history of male oppression, the foundations of masculinity, and the evolution of the modern man. Join author Rod E. Keays as he examines these important topics and more, including why boys and men accept certain roles; why men bully each other; why its important to deal with emotions; and why its so hard for men to talk about intimacy.
Keays explores his own experiences coping with the twists and turns that come with being a man. One thing he learns early on is that most men dont talk about their emotional highs and lows. As someone who likes to talk openly and frankly, he has felt isolated, but he continues living life on his terms.
Discover what good men have been doing for thousands of years and how mens groups can help men achieve their goals. The world may have its share of problems, but The Naturally Good Man continues to contribute to society." />
