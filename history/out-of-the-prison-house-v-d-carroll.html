  <title>Out of the Prison House - V.D. Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Out of the Prison House is the story of Kenneth Bentley, a United States Marine squad leader via field promotion, who is wounded in action and taken prisoner in September, 1969. He survives four years of captivity in an iron cage, tortured when he attempts escape.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After he learns of the United States&#39; surrender and believing there are no other Americans around, he tries to adapt to a new life and identity when he is handled like the French &quot;pearls&quot; in the fifties, who were forced to assimilate into the Viet culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled in a secluded village in North Vietnam and struggling with dual identities, is he to spend the rest of his life in that remote area, or will he emerge from that isolation to rejoin family back home? And what sort of culture shock would he endure if he did come back to face the attacks of 9/11/2001?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Out of the Prison House presents a powerful view of the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue from the perspective of the men left behind. V. D. Carroll has a keen insight into America&#39;s P.O.W. tragedy, and sets forth a realistic picture of P.O.W. life. This stirring, true-to-life story could belong to any one of the men abandoned in Southeast Asia.&quot; Eugene &quot;Red&quot; McDaniel, CAPT, USN (Ret.), founder of American Defense Institute, and P.O.W., Vietnam, for over six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This vibrant story brings emotional closure to the heart-wounds of those whose loved ones have not returned from Southeast Asia.&quot; Cindy Kuehl, daughter of a P.O.W./M.I.A.&lt;/p&gt;" />
