  <title>The Five George Masons - Pamela C. Copeland, Richard K. McMaster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Founding Father, a patriot in the Revolutionary War, a delegate from
    Virginia to the Constitutional Convention, and one of the driving forces behind the creation of
    the U.S. Bill of Rights, George Mason (1725-1792) worked passionately and diligently throughout
    his life, both as a private citizen and as a public servant, to ensure that government protected
    the inherent rights of the people. &lt;i&gt;The Five George Masons,&lt;/i&gt; first published in
    1975, provides a comprehensive overview of five generations of the Mason family, beginning with
    George Mason I, who fled England following the defeat of the Royalists at the second battle of
    Worcester in 1651, arriving in the Colony of Virginia in the early 1650s. Central to this
    volume, of course, is George Mason IV, who, while less celebrated than his fellow Virginians
    George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, was one of America’s outstanding thinkers,
    legislators, and writers; his ideals and legacy endure to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
    second edition includes a new foreword as well as color photos and maps, while faithfully
    reproducing the original edition’s unique genealogical charts of the Mason family. In
    tracing the family history of the Masons, the book provides important context for understanding
    the life and work of George Mason IV, who wrote: &quot;All men are by nature equally free and
    inde¬pendent, and have certain inherent rights.&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Five George
    Masons&lt;/i&gt; serves as a uniquely valuable resource for histo¬rians, educators,
    genealogists, and all those interested in the history of Virginia and the early United
    States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distributed for the George Mason University
