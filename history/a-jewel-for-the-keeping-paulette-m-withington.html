  <title>A Jewel for the Keeping - Paulette M. Withington</title>

&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The legend had lived for more
than a century, yet, in spite of eye witnesses who had seen her ghost, no one
wanted to believe the validity of The Blue Lady. Why was she haunting Brindle
Point? What was she trying to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;After one dockside farewell too
many, Josiah Abbotts need for hearth and home suddenly outweigh his taste for
salt air and billowing sails. When he is offered the commission of lighthouse
keeper at a &lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Virginia&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; lighthouse
station; he jumps at the chance and hangs up his captains hat for good. His
family is more than willing to follow him to the new lighthouse, but will the
ghost of Brindle Point welcome them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Can obstacles like: unannounced
inspections, coastal storms and ghostly apparitions surmount their faith, or,
will they ingratiate the Abbotts into a deeper love for the life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;As the passing crew of a line
packet ship becomes distracted by a murder on board, they face disaster.
Josiahs daughter must put her faith into actions when one of the injured crew
members falls in love with her.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;When the mending crew is brought
before a board of inquiry, previous encounters with this ghost can no longer be
kept secret. Only, after the &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Abbotts&lt;/span&gt; decipher
messages revealed by the ghost, can they discover truth, the true meaning of
love and a true jewel for the keeping.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
