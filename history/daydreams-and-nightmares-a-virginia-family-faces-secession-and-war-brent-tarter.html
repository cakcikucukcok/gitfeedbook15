  <title>Daydreams and Nightmares: A Virginia Family Faces Secession and War - Brent Tarter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision of the eventual Confederate states to secede from the Union     set in motion perhaps the most dramatic chapter in American history, and one that has typically     been told on a grand scale. In &lt;i&gt;Daydreams and Nightmares,&lt;/i&gt; however, historian     Brent Tarter shares the story of one Virginia family who found themselves in the middle of the     secession debate and saw their world torn apart as the states chose sides and went to     war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Berlin was elected to serve as a delegate to the Virginia     Convention of 1861 as an opponent of secession, but he ultimately changed his vote. Later, when     defending his decision in a speech in his hometown of Buckhannon, Upshur County, he had to flee     for his safety as Union soldiers arrived. Berlin and his wife, Susan Holt Berlin, were separated     for extended periods--both during the convention and, later, during the early years of the Civil     War. The letters they exchanged tell a harrowing story of uncertainty and bring to life for the     modern reader an extended family that encompassed both Confederate and Union     sympathizers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is in part a love story. It is also a story about ordinary     people caught up in extraordinary events. Although unique in its vividly evoked details, the     Berlins&#39; story is representative of the drama endured by millions of Americans. Composed     during the nightmare of civil war, the Berlins&#39; remarkably articulate letters express the     dreams of reunion and a secure future felt throughout the entire, severed nation. In this     intimate, evocative, and often heartbreaking family story, we see up close the personal costs of     our larger national history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nation Divided: Studies in     the Civil War&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
