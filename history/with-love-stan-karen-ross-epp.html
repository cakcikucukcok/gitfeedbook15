  <title>With Love Stan - Karen Ross Epp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On August 7, 1969, when I and a half dozen other soldiers were cut off from other friendly forces and were nearly out of ammunition in a desperate fight with a much larger force of North Vietnamese regulars, I was not surprised to see Ross among the few who risked their lives to come to our assistance. Less than three months later Ross fell mortally wounded in still another battle. Karen [Epps] work to document her brothers life and death is a unique effort that contributes to the full story of a long, controversial war that still has major impact on our country today.  It is a tribute to not only Stan and Karens family, but also to all veterans.

My gratitude to my brother and those brave service men and women can never be expressed in words. Stan and those like him still live on in our hearts. His courage should inspire all of us to do a better job of living.
