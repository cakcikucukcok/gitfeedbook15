  <title>The Laney Saga - Don W. Laney, Donald Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;The Laney Saga&quot; is an historical fiction about the ancestry and lives of Titus and Hannah Laney. The book is actually three books, depicting the ancestry of Titus, the ancestry of Hannah and finally, their life together. The book begins in the year 69 AD with the Roman army. Over the course of the next 300 pages we see how Laney ancestors dealt with hunger, marauders, the elements, the Black Death, religion, and persecution. You will be enthralled with Hannah&#39;s ancestors: characters such as Dei, Carlin, Teige, Liam, Sophie and Carrie. You will be equally impressed with the ancestors of Titus: Derry, Boruck, Harold, Joseph and Olaf. Some of the characters actually existed such as Hugh Slaini, Teigena Lann, Dubslane, Finn, O&#39;Dubhshlaine and Johann Lennich. This book is a walk through history as we see what molded our ancestors and made them the men and women that still influences their descendants to this day. There is romance, anger, religious persecution, witchcraft, plague, war and even a fight in the coliseum at Rome. The Roman Empire, Druids, Feudalism, the Thirty Years&#39; War, sailing the Atlantic, wagon trains, Indians and the Revolutionary War are all mentioned. The book begins with Titus and Hannah&#39;s ancestors caught up in 69 AD in a war with Rome. It concludes with one of their ancestors serving in the military in Iraq. And in between, there are many wonderful adventures and surprises. Read and enjoy.&lt;/P&gt;" />
