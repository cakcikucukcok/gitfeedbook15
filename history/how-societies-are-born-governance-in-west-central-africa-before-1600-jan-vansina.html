  <title>How Societies Are Born: Governance in West Central Africa before 1600 - Jan Vansina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like stars, societies are born, and this story deals with such a birth. It asks a     fundamental and compelling question: How did societies first coalesce from the small foraging     communities that had roamed in West Central Africa for many thousands of     years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan Vansina continues a career-long effort to reconstruct the history     of African societies before European contact in &lt;i&gt;How Societies Are Born.&lt;/i&gt; In     this complement to his previous study &lt;i&gt;Paths in the Rainforests,&lt;/i&gt; Vansina     employs a provocative combination of archaeology and historical linguistics to turn his     scholarly focus to governance, studying the creation of relatively large societies extending     beyond the foraging groups that characterized west central Africa from the beginning of human     habitation to around 500 BCE, and the institutions that bridged their constituent local     communities and made large-scale cooperation possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing reliance     on cereal crops, iron tools, large herds of cattle, and overarching institutions such as     corporate matrilineages and dispersed matriclans lead up to the developments treated in the     second part of the book. From about 900 BCE until European contact, different societies chose     different developmental paths. Interestingly, these proceeded well beyond environmental     constraints and were characterized by &quot;major differences in the subjects which enthralled     people,&quot; whether these were cattle, initiations and social position, or &quot;the splendors     of sacralized leaders and the possibilities of participating in them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
