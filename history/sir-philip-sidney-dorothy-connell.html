  <title>Sir Philip Sidney - Dorothy Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Queen Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s court, 1580: Europe was at war or under Inquisition rule, sea voyages were opening an exciting New World, but England alone kept to a rare and tenuous peace. Philip Sidney was highly-educated, well-travelled and fitted for a career in diplomacy or soldiery, a friend to Europe&amp;rsquo;s most prominent Protestant intellectuals, many of whom lived in exile. But at home he was idle and fell under a cloud when he opposed the Queen&amp;rsquo;s marriage to the French Duke of Anjou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Philip, the child of royal servants and scion of the powerful Dudley family, join the stream of exiles? Instead he made another choice: to become a &lt;em&gt;maker&lt;/em&gt; or poet. In doing so, despite his unpublished works and early death in 1586 at the age of thirty-two, he became one of the glories of English literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his works were first published posthumously in the 1590s, the playwright Shakespeare, like others of a younger generation, was strongly influenced to carry Sidney&amp;rsquo;s style, themes and stories onward into &lt;em&gt;As You Like It&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;King Lear&lt;/em&gt;, his own &lt;em&gt;Sonnets&lt;/em&gt; and other writings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorothy Connell&amp;rsquo;s book, first published by Oxford University Press in 1977, now re-issued and updated for the digital age, elegantly bridges the historical, courtly, playful and poetical elements so mixed in Sir Philip Sidney&amp;rsquo;s life and work in order to give the reader a vibrant picture of the man, his milieu and Renaissance Europe in his time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
