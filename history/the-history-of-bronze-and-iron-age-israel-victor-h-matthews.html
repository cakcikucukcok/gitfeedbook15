  <title>The History of Bronze and Iron Age Israel - Victor H. Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Designed as a supplementary resource for students who have an interest in the ancient Near East and biblical history, this volume provides a basic introduction to the historical, archaeological, and socio-contextual aspects of ancient Israel during its early foundation period through the end of the monarchy in Judah. Victor Matthews integrates extra-biblical information on the physical realities of geo- and super-power politics, international and interregional movement of peoples, and the evolutionary process of complex states in the ancient Near East with information from biblical narratives in order to explore the development of ancient Israelites&#39; identity, cultural traditions, and interactions with other major cultures. In particular, he examines aspects of everyday life in both village culture and urban settings as a key to the development of social, legal, and religious traditions and practices. &lt;em&gt;The History of Bronze and Iron Age Israel&lt;/em&gt; features an easy to navigate format, non-technical language, and a series of informative insets that highlights important methodological concepts and comparative material." />
