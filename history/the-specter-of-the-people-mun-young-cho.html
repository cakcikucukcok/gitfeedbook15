  <title>The Specter of &quot;the People&quot; - Mun Young Cho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Despite massive changes to its economic policies, China continues to define itself as socialist; since 1949 and into the present, the Maoist slogan &quot;Serve the People&quot; has been a central point of moral and political orientation. Yet several decades of market-based reforms have resulted in high urban unemployment, transforming the proletariat vanguard into a new urban poor. How do unemployed workers come to terms with their split status, economically marginalized but still rhetorically central to the way China claims to understand itself? How does a state dedicated to serving &quot;the people&quot; manage the poverty of its citizens? Mun Young Cho addresses these questions in a book based on more than two years of fieldwork in a decaying residential area of Harbin in the northeast province of Heilongjiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cho analyzes the different experiences of poverty among laid-off urban workers and recent rural-to-urban migrants, two groups that share a common economic duress in China&#39;s Rustbelt cities but who rarely unite as one class owed protection by the state. Impoverished workers, she shows, seek protection and recognition by making claims about &quot;the people&quot; and what they deserve. They redeploy the very language that the party-state had once used to venerate them, although their claim often contradicts government directives regarding how &quot;the people&quot; should be reborn as self-managing subjects. The slogan &quot;serve the people&quot; is no longer a promise of the party-state but rather a demand made by the unemployed and the poor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
