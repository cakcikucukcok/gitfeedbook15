  <title>Moderate Radical - Rosamund Oates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Moderate Radical explores an exciting period of English, and British, history:  Elizabethan and Early Stuart religious politics. Tobie Matthew (c. 1544-1628) started Elizabeth&#39;s reign as a religious radical, yet ended up running the English Church during the tumultuous years leading up to the British Civil Wars. Moderate Radical provides a new perspective on this period, and an insight into the power of conforming puritanism as a political and
cultural force.  Matthew&#39;s vision of conformity and godly magistracy brought many puritans into the Church, but also furnished them with a justification for rebellion when the puritanism was seriously threatened.  Through exciting new sources - Matthew&#39;s annotations of his extensive library and newly discovered sermons -
Rosamund Oates explores the guiding principles of puritanism in the period and explains why the godly promoted the national church, even when it seemed corrupt. She demonstrates how Matthew protected puritans, but his protection meant that there was a rich seam of dissent at the heart of the Church that emerged when the godly found themselves under attack in the 1620s and 1630s.
This is a story about accommodations, conformity and government, as well as a biography of a leading figure in the Church, who struggled to come to terms with his own son&#39;s Catholicism and the disappointments of his family. Moderate Radical makes an important contribution to the emerging field of sermon studies, exploring the rich cultures derived from sermons as well as re-creating some of the drama of Matthew&#39;s preaching. It offers a new insight into tensions of the pre-Civil War
Church." />
