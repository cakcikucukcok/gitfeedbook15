  <title>Catiline - Henrik Hibsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Henrik Johan Ibsen&lt;/b&gt; (20 March 1828 &amp;ndash; 23 May 1906) was a major 19th-century Norwegian playwright, theatre director, and poet. He is often referred to as &amp;quot;the father of realism&amp;quot; and is one of the founders of Modernism in theatre. His major works include &lt;i&gt;Brand&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Peer Gynt&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;An Enemy of the People&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Emperor and Galilean&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A Doll&amp;#39;s House&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hedda Gabler&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ghosts&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Wild Duck&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;When We Dead Awaken&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pillars of Society&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lady from the Sea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rosmersholm&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Master Builder&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;John Gabriel Borkman&lt;/i&gt;. He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare, and by the early 20th century &lt;i&gt;A Doll&amp;#39;s House&lt;/i&gt; became the world&amp;#39;s most performed play. &amp;nbsp;Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen&amp;#39;s later work examined the realities that lay behind many fa&amp;ccedil;ades, revealing much that was disquieting to many contemporaries. It utilized a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. The poetic and cinematic early play &lt;i&gt;Peer Gynt&lt;/i&gt;, however, has strong surreal elements. Catilina&amp;#39;s mood-swings are a bit unrealistic, but considering it&amp;#39;s Ibsen&amp;#39;s first play it&amp;#39;s good. The language is outdated but it&amp;#39;s not hard to understand. It is very clear that he draws inspiration from 1848 and the revolution that raged across Europe." />
