  <title>The Natural History Of German Life - George  Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;History of German Life. &quot;In Germany, perhaps more than in any other  country, it is among the peasantry that we must look for the historical  type of the national physique. In the towns this type has become so  modified to express the personality of the individual that even &quot;family  likeness&quot; is often but faintly marked. But the peasants may still be  distinguished into groups, by their physical peculiarities. In one part  of the country we find a longer-legged, in another a broader-shouldered  race, which has inherited these peculiarities for centuries.  ...Between  many villages an historical feud, once perhaps the occasion of much  bloodshed, is still kept up under the milder form of an occasional round  of cudgelling and the launching of traditional nicknames. An historical  feud of this kind still exists, for example, among many villages on the  Rhine and more inland places in the neighborhood. ... ... Marriage is a  very prudential affair, especially among the peasants who have the  largest share of property. ... The girls marry young, ...&lt;/p&gt;
