  <title>Akhenaten - One of the Many Books of Hermes - Karin Hannah, Valma Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Pilgrimage
The first section of the story of Akhenaten is told by Ambrose, the soul self of Akhenaten/Smenkhkare.  He begins by speaking of the distant beginnings of Earths evolvement and that of all earlier species and the divine orchestration behind all of Earths evolvement and adorning. Thereafter he speaks of Amilius Hermes and the Great Division that was brought about the creative experimentation indulged in by a certain group of Divine Brethren (not of the angelic realm). From there he speaks of the pilgrimages that were required in divine reparation and healing, that which brought about the Hermetic vibration. He goes on to speak of the returning pilgrimages by the incarnate visitations of the extra-terrestrially evolved Hermetic vibration as well as those who eventually incarnated solely upon Earth.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Soon he comes to speaking briefly of his overlapping dual incarnations as the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten and his brother Prince Smenkhkare and their souls close connection with Amilius Hermes and the Hermetic vibration. And so he finishes by summing up his own soul selfs spiritual lineage and a brief address to the reader of his story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meritaten&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 It is Meritaten who tells the second section of the story and therein she gives her account of her father Akhenaten and his life. She tells us of her father and includes details of her own life and that of her beloved sisters and soon informs us that when she was born she already had two older sisters. She also speaks of her mother Nefertiti and even twice briefly mentions her beloved grandmother Tiy and grandfather Amenophis III.  Of course she in due time speaks adoringly of the two loves of her life, her husband Prince Smenkhkare (and later the Pharaoh Smenkhkare) and her son Tutankhaten (Tutankhamun). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Near the beginning of her story she informs us that she and her sisters were all taught not only to write detailed stories but also to perform them. Meritaten is a consummate story teller with a great sense of place and a sometimes poetic turn of phrase. Her account expresses the whole range of their human experience amid the fine detail of their physical surroundings. She ranges from poignant and touching, often amusing and right through to her own personal traumatic emotional pain and thereafter to the gradual tragedy all of their lives eventually became. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Keep in mind that Meritaten and Tutankhaten were the dual soul aspects of Ambroses twin self Ursu). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tutankhaten &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And now it is (Tutankhamun) who takes up the telling of the third and final part of the story of Akhenaten, speaking from the position he assumed when having incarnated as Akhenatens only son. He speaks openly about the fact that thereafter Akhenaten and Smenkhkares deaths he was soon forcibly renamed Tutankhamun when crowned. Even from the very beginning of his account he decidedly states that his true name was and is Tutankhaten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While sharing his memories of his father, he also tells very well the story of his own short lifetime and that of his adored mother Meritaten and Smenkhkare whom he fondly called his second-father. His amiable half-sisters he speaks of also, and later of his grandmother Nefertiti and her brother the universally despised Ay. The latter being his greatest oppressor. And last but certainly far from least, we are privy to a most fervently detailed account of the unenviable relationship between himself and his beloved half-sister and queen Ankhesenapaaten (who was also forcibly renamed Ankhesenamun). And that they had been compelled to marry under such duress he also refers to their life as captives of state, those living within a luxuriously appointed prison. 
Like his mother Meritaten he later recounts his experiences after passing over into Spirit, although his personal experiences were quite different from hers in that they contain strong elements of both the dark and the light. Even s" />
