  <title>35 Degrees 24 Minutes North - 91 Degrees West - Johnny H. Wilson, Isaac A. Bratcher, Don Evans, James O. Jeffers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A history of the settlement and development of the townships of Brushy Lake and Hickory Ridge and of the emergence of the town of Hickory ridge, all located within the state of Arkansas. The time span covered begins with the discovery of America and comes forth to about the year 2000. It includes such events as DeSoto&#39;s trek through the area, transfer of ownership via the Louisiana Purchase, regional exploration and surveying, territorial politics and gaining the status of statehood. Following the time of the Civil War, the narrative focuses more on the development of Cross County, the two townships of Brushy Lake and Hickory Ridge and, finally, on the town of hickory Ridge. A history of some of the region&#39;s schools, churches, and cemeteries is included as well as several maps, some as early as 1819, a full record of Cross County post offices, Peace Court Records from the early part of the 20th century, and many random photographs." />
