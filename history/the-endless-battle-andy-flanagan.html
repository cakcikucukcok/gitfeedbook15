  <title>The Endless Battle - Andy Flanagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Near the end of October 1941, a few hundred soldiers from New Brunswick were among the 1,975 Canadian troops who set sail from Vancouver to reinforce the British Colony of Hong Kong. Within two short months, after a hard-fought but disastrous battle against the Imperial Japanese Army, the island fell to the invaders on Christmas Day, and its defenders were ordered to surrender by the governor of Hong Kong. The survivors were taken captive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the first-hand accounts of the author&#39;s father, Andrew “Ando” Flanagan, a rifleman from Jacquet River, NB, &lt;i&gt;The Endless Battle&lt;/i&gt; explores the Battle of Hong Kong and its long aftermath, through the eyes of the soldiers. During their captivity, the POWs endured starvation, forced labour, and brutal beatings. They lived in deplorable conditions and many died from illness. But the soldiers stuck together, bound by their camaraderie, loyalty to King and Country, and collective desire to sabotage the Japanese war effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing intimately and sensitively about the lingering effects of the trauma of the soldiers held in captivity, Andy Flanagan shows both the heroism of individual soldiers and the terrible costs of war.&lt;/p&gt;" />
