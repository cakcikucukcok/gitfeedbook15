  <title>13 Stradomska Street - Andrew Potok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;Potok is blind but he makes us see not only the pre-World War Two landscape from which he and his family fled, but also how and why and at what price.&quot; &amp;#151;Jay Neugeboren, author of &quot;Max Baer and the Star of David&quot; and &quot;Imagining Robert&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Potok explores the long reach of both his family&#39;s 1939 escape from Poland and his own blindness in this thoughtful and elegant memoir.&quot; &amp;#151;Elinor Langer, author of &quot;Josephine Herbst&quot; and &quot;A Hundred Little Hitlers&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Andrew Potok was eight he fled with his family from Warsaw, leaving home and business to escape the invading Nazis. The family made it to American, but Andrew&amp;#8217;s memories of violence, Jew hatred, and betrayal--including that of his father--erupted into nightmares and eventually formed the backdrop of his rich, though at times turbulent, life as an artist and writer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When, late in Andrew&#39;s life, a Polish lawyer offers to help him reclaim property in Krakow that was wrongfully inherited by a relative, he and his wife revisit Poland, with its still-virulent anti-Semitism. The visit awakens long-dormant memories and provokes deep reflections on the nature of evil. The ongoing lawsuit becomes emblematic of the book&amp;#8217;s central theme: There can be no closure for survivors of the Holocaust--no justice for either victims or perpetrators, no compensation, and no forgiveness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Andrew Potok was a successful visual artist until he went blind in his forties. He then turned to writing and published &quot;Ordinary Daylight, Portrait of An Artist Going Blind,&quot; &quot;My Life With Goya,&quot; and &quot;A Matter of Dignity.&quot; He lives in Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
