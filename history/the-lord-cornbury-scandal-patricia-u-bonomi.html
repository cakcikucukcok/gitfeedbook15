  <title>The Lord Cornbury Scandal - Patricia U. Bonomi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For more than two centuries, Edward Hyde, Viscount Cornbury--royal governor of New York and New Jersey from 1702 to 1708--has been a despised figure, whose alleged transgressions ranged from raiding the public treasury to scandalizing his subjects by parading through the streets of New York City dressed as a woman.&lt;br/&gt;Now, Patricia Bonomi offers a challenging reassessment of Cornbury. She explores his life and experiences to illuminate such topics as imperial political culture; gossip, Grub Street, and the climate of slander; early modern sexual culture; and constitutional perceptions in an era of reform. In a tour de force of scholarly detective work, Bonomi also reappraises the most &quot;conclusive&quot; piece of evidence used to indict Cornbury--a celebrated portrait, said to represent the governor in female dress, that hangs today in the New-York Historical Society. &lt;br/&gt;Stripping away the many layers of &quot;the Cornbury myth,&quot; this innovative work brings to life a fascinating man and reveals the conflicting emotions and loyalties that shaped the politics of the First British Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!-- copy for pb reprint-for catalog quotes should go below short description--&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;A tour de force of historical detection.--Tim Hilchey, &lt;/i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Bonomi&#39;s book is more than an exoneration of Cornbury. It is a case study of what she aptly calls the politics of reputation.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;--Edmund S. Morgan, &lt;/i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;A fascinating, authoritative glimpse into the seamy underside of imperial politics in the late Stuart era.--Timothy D. Hall, &lt;/i&gt;Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;An intriguing detective story that....casts light upon the operation of political power in the past and the nature of history writing in the present.--Alan Taylor, &lt;/i&gt;New Republic&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more than two centuries, Edward Hyde, Viscount Cornbury--royal governor of New York and New Jersey from 1702 to 1708--has been a despised figure whose alleged transgressions ranged from looting the colonial treasury to public cross dressing in New York City. Stripping away the many layers of &quot;the Cornbury myth,&quot; Patricia Bonomi offers a challenging reassessment of this fascinating figure and of the rough and tumble political culture of the First British Empire--with its muckraking press, salacious gossip, and conflicting imperial loyalties. --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
