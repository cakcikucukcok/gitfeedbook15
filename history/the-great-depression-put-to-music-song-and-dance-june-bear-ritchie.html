  <title>The Great Depression Put to Music, Song and Dance - June Bear Ritchie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Great Depression is a part of real history that really did happen. In 1929 was when it was really bad. People were hungry there were no jobs and no money.
I was born the 1929 and the depression went all through the twenties and thirties and into the early forties; but times were getting bad. The depression was taking its toll on everything and everyone. A little money went a long way, but there was no money and to top everything off the stock market fell and everyone lost their money in the stock market, the banks closed their doors, no one could bet their money out. My father had a friend that lost all of his money in the bank in 1929. If you didn&#39;t live in this time of history you can&#39;t imagine what life was like. I watched my father walk 4miles to work in a rock quarry carrying his lunch box then walk home after sledging rock all day. My mother raised a vegetable garden and canned a lot of food so we would have food for the winter. This is just a preview.
Now, how did I come up with the name of my book? The Great Depression Put to Music, Song and Dance.
My father played violin and mother played piano - Music
My sister and I sang - Song
I grew up to teach dance - Dance" />
