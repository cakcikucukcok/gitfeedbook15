  <title>An Inward Journey - Fran Zabaleta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;THE STORY OF AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY BY CAMPER VAN THROUGH THE FORGOTTEN HEART OF SPAIN&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;b&gt;Do I really know my own country?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
That&#39;s what I asked myself a year ago ... and the answer surprised me. Yes, I had been to many locations. I was very familiar with the outer edges of the peninsula, but the interior was a huge black hole pierced here and there by the lights of some city.
&lt;b&gt;So I set out to remedy it.&lt;/b&gt;
I bought a van adapted as a home and I went to explore the interior of Spain. For eighty days I visited &lt;b&gt;villages, castles, natural parks and archaeological sites&lt;/b&gt;, talked with people, researched a thousand stories and looked out into a world that was curiously familiar and, at the same time, completely unknown.
The result is in your hands: &lt;b&gt;an approach to the history, geography and present day realities &lt;/b&gt;of a country which is much larger, richer and more complex than we were ever told. A country that overflows with a rich heritage and an archaeological, historical and cultural wealth, full of amazing nooks and crannies, but also depopulated and lonely. A deeply beautiful country that is truly worth the effort of exploring in depth, getting lost in its innermost recesses and diving into its extraordinary past.
&lt;b&gt;Will you come with me on a voyage through this forgotten Spain?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
