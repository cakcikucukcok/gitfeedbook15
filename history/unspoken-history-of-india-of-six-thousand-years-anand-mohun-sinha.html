  <title>Unspoken History of India of Six-Thousand Years - Anand Mohun Sinha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An evolved civilization existed in India, much before the advent of Roman, Greek, Egyptian or Chinese civilizations in this world. And, yet, India is the only country among them, which went into subjugation, in the last millennium. This book gives an insight into its reasons. It also brings out, why Indians are brilliant individually, but collectively, they belong to a third world country. It dwells on their strength and weaknesses developed over 6000 years, which remain unspoken or spoken in disguise. Also, it reflects on the reasons why great men like Shiv, Ganesh, Hanuman and Krishna, who were born just like Christ, Mohammed and Buddha were consigned into mythology. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The readers may find much rationality in its bold attempt to reveal the harsh truth. It also provides thought-provoking solutions, to ponder and act." />
