  <title>Satan and Salem - Benjamin C. Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of a perfect storm of factors that culminated in a great moral
    catastrophe, the Salem witch trials of 1692 took a breathtaking toll on the young English colony
    of Massachusetts. Over 150 people were imprisoned, and nineteen men and women, including a
    minister, were executed by hanging. The colonial government, which was responsible for
    initiating the trials, eventually repudiated the entire affair as a great &quot;delusion of the
    Devil.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Satan and Salem,&lt;/i&gt; Benjamin Ray looks beyond
    single-factor interpretations to offer a far more nuanced view of why the Salem witch-hunt
    spiraled out of control. Rather than assigning blame to a single perpetrator, Ray assembles
    portraits of several major characters, each of whom had complex motives for accusing his or her
    neighbors. In this way, he reveals how religious, social, political, and legal factors all
    played a role in the drama. Ray’s historical database of court records, documents, and
    maps yields a unique analysis of the geographic spread of accusations and trials, ultimately
    showing how the witch-hunt resulted in the execution of so many people—far more than any
    comparable episode on this side of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the print
    volume, &lt;i&gt;Satan and Salem&lt;/i&gt; will also be available as a linked e-book offering
    the reader the opportunity to investigate firsthand the primary sources and maps on which
    Ray’s groundbreaking argument rests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
