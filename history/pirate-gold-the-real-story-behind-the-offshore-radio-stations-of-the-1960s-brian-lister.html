  <title>Pirate Gold: The Real Story Behind the Offshore Radio Stations of the 1960s - Brian Lister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fifty years ago, after a long delay, the government acted to close down the dozen or so pirate radio stations which had sprung up around the British coast.  Many of the stories about those ships and offshore forts, and the personalities involved, are well known, but this book asks intriguing questions about what was really going on behind the scenes.   It is common to conflate the rise of the UK pirate radio stations with the liberation struggles going on at the same time:  civil rights protests, anti-war movements, student unrest and increasingly liberal attitudes to sex.  Fifty years on we can appreciate the reality: the people behind the early offshore stations were frequently motivated by very different agendas and often the ships and forts were simply pawns in much bigger power games.    Pirate Gold shines a light on the social, political and technological background to the rise of the UK offshore pirate stations and their lasting effect on British radio broadcasting." />
