  <title>Letters from Beauly - Melynda Jarratt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted, New Brunswick Book Award for Non-Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Second World War, hundreds of New Brunswick woodsmen joined the Canadian Forestry Corps to log the Scottish Highlands as part of the Canadian war effort. Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Hennessy of Bathurst was one of them. For five years, Pat served as camp cook with 15 Company of the Canadian Forestry Corps near the ancient town of Beauly, Scotland. A middle-aged New Brunswick farmer and lumberman with a third-grade education, Pat saw more of the world than he had ever dreamed of, visiting ancient battlefields he had learned about as a child, travelling to his ancestral Ireland, and attending a course of lectures in British history at Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While in Scotland, Pat regularly corresponded with his family in New Brunswick. Drawing from this unique collection of more than three hundred letters, as well as hundreds of archival documents and photographs, Melynda Jarratt provides a rare glimpse of what life was like for Canadian servicemen overseas and for their relatives at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Letters from Beauly is volume 23 in the New Brunswick Military Heritage Series, co-published with the Gregg Centre for the Study of War and Society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
