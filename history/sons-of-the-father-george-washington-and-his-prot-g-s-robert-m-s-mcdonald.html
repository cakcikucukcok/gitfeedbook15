  <title>Sons of the Father: George Washington and His Protégés - Robert M. S. McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether acting as a military officer or civilian officeholder, George     Washington did not possess a reputation for glad handing, easy confidences, or even much warmth.     His greatest attributes as a commander might well have been his firm command over his own     emotions and the way in which he held himself above if not apart from the men he led.     Understanding the full range of Washington&#39;s leadership, which embraced all shades of persuasion     and coercion as well as multiple modes of command and solicitude, requires the examination of     his influence on the lives, careers, and characters of the members of a diverse fraternity of     younger men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sons of the Father,&lt;/i&gt; leading scholars     analyze Washington&#39;s relationships with men such as Daniel Morgan, Anthony Wayne, Thomas     Jefferson, James Monroe, Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, Gouverneur Morris, Alexander Hamilton,     and the Marquis de Lafayette. The men on whom this volume focuses were not all his closest     associates. Yet all are important figures in that their interactions with Washington provide     glimpses into various aspects of his capacities for management, motivation, control, and the     cultivation of talent. The essays in this volume demonstrate Washington&#39;s consistency in     treating all these men differently, for different reasons, at different times. It was perhaps     part of his genius to recognize the individuality of the men with whom he interacted as well as     the shifting requirements of changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     &lt;i&gt;Contributors:&lt;/i&gt; Fred Anderson (University of Colorado, Boulder) * Theodore     J.
