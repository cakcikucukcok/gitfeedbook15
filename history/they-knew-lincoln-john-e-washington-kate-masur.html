  <title>They Knew Lincoln - John E. Washington, Kate Masur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Originally published in 1942 and now reprinted for the first time, &lt;em&gt;They Knew Lincoln &lt;/em&gt;is a classic in African American history and Lincoln studies.  Part memoir and part history, the book is an account of John E. Washington&#39;s childhood among African Americans in Washington, DC, and of the black people who knew or encountered Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln.
Washington recounted stories told by his grandmother&#39;s elderly friends--stories of escaping from slavery, meeting Lincoln in the Capitol, learning of the president&#39;s assassination, and hearing ghosts at Ford&#39;s Theatre.  He also mined the US government archives and researched little-known figures in Lincoln&#39;s life, including William Johnson, who accompanied Lincoln from Springfield to Washington, and William Slade, the steward in Lincoln&#39;s White House. Washington was fascinated from childhood by the question of how much African Americans themselves had shaped Lincoln&#39;s views on slavery and race, and he believed Lincoln&#39;s Haitian-born barber, William de Fleurville, was a crucial influence. Washington also extensively researched Elizabeth Keckly, the dressmaker to Mary Todd Lincoln, and advanced a new theory of who helped her write her controversial book, &lt;em&gt;Behind the Scenes,&lt;/em&gt;
A new introduction by Kate Masur places Washington&#39;s book in its own context, explaining the contents of &lt;em&gt;They Knew Lincoln &lt;/em&gt;in light of not only the era of emancipation and the Civil War, but also Washington&#39;s own times, when the nation&#39;s capital was a place of great opportunity and creativity for members of the African American elite. On publication, a reviewer noted that the &quot;collection of Negro stories, memories, legends about Lincoln&quot; seemed &quot;to fill such an obvious gap in the material about Lincoln that one wonders why no one ever did it before.&quot;  This edition brings it back to print for a twenty-first century readership that remains fascinated with Abraham Lincoln." />
