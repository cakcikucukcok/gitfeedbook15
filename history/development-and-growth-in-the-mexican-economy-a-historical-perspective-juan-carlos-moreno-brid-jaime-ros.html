  <title>Development and Growth in the Mexican Economy: A Historical Perspective - Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid, Jaime Ros</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the first comprehensive and systematic English-language treatment of Mexicos economic history to appear in nearly forty years. Drawing on several years of in-depth research, Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid and Jaime Ros, two of the foremost experts on the Mexican economy, examine Mexicos current development policies and problems from a historical perspective. They review long-term trends in the Mexican economy and analyze past episodes of radical shifts in development strategy and in the role of markets and the state. This book provides an overview of Mexicos economic development since Independence that compares the successive periods of stagnation and growth that alternately have characterized Mexicos economic history. It gives special attention to developments since 1940, and it presents a re-evaluation of Mexicos development policies during the State-led industrialization period from 1940 to 1982 as well as during the more recent market reform process. This reevaluation is critical of the dominant trend in economic literature and is revisionist in arguing that, in particular, the market reforms undertaken by successive Mexican governments since 1983 have not addressed the fundamental obstacles to economic growth. Development and Growth in the Mexican Economy also details the countrys pioneering role in launching NAFTA, its membership in the OECD, and its radical macroeconomic reforms. Carefully argued and meticulously researched, the book presents a wide-ranging, authoritative study that not only pinpoints problems, but also suggests solutions for removing obstacles to economic stability and pointing the Mexican economy toward the road to recovery." />
