  <title>Man No Be God - Dieter Lemke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;man no be God&lt;/i&gt; is a story of a willing and driven Canadian doctor who spent his life immersed in the wonderful, complex and interesting lives of the people of  western Cameroon. The individuals he went to learn from, to serve, to encourage, to support, and to befriend together provide a fascinating look at familiar struggles and triumphs in an unfamiliar setting. There is nothing more fulfilling or satisfying than being involved in and involved with others. &lt;P&gt;Although this writer has the satisfaction of knowing that he has done what he was called to do, there is a vast and frightening opportunity for the reader to dare to take the same challenge.
AIDS does not threaten to destroy a great horde of faceless peopleit is far worse. It is destroying lovely, interesting, vibrant, and extremely valuable individuals, one at a time, relentlessly, killing off a significant part of each of us as it marches through Africa.
&lt;P&gt;One mans experience, and willingness to throw talent, brains, and brawn into being a part of peoples individual lives made a difference to many, and enriched him far more than he ever thought possible. (Thats how the mundane becomes meaningful, after all). Therein lies the glimmer of hope, and the challenge. Anyone can, if anyone will, make a difference to at least one other. Doing so in the face of this killer sharpens and focuses that challengeand its rewardsimmensely." />
