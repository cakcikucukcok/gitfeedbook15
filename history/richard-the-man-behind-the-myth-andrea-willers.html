  <title>Richard, the Man Behind the Myth - Andrea Willers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Richard was born, being the youngest son and child of the Duke and Duchess of York, he seemed the most unlikely person to become King. He had learnt at Middleham Castle to be a soldier and a knight, and that is where he first met Anne Neville, later to be his wife. Life had ended abruptly when the Earl of Warwick had fallen out with Edward IV, and Richard was in Edward IV court with its plots and intrigues and unpopular scheming Woodvilles.  Richard had married Anne, became the lord of the North, and was well loved.  His whole life changed when news came of his brother Edwards death. He reluctantly went to London only to find himself in the middle of a hornets nest. Tales of murder and Margaret Beauforts hidden agendas had never made it easy. By the time Bosworth happened, Richard had certainly had nothing but bad luck during his time as King. He had lost his only son and only just become a widow, death must have been preferable. It had seemed that even in death, he had no luck. He was to become the product of Tudor propaganda, a villain in the history books." />
