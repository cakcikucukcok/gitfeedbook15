  <title>Brothers Born of One Mother - Michelle LeMaster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of English settlers in the American Southeast in 1670 brought
    the British and the Native Americans into contact both with foreign peoples and with unfamiliar
    gender systems. In a region in which the balance of power between multiple players remained
    uncertain for many decades, British and Native leaders turned to concepts of gender and family
    to create new diplomatic norms to govern interactions as they sought to construct and maintain
    working relationships. In &lt;i&gt;Brothers Born of One Mother, &lt;/i&gt;Michelle LeMaster
    addresses the question of how differing cultural attitudes toward gender influenced Anglo-Indian
    relations in the colonial Southeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the most fundamental aspects of
    culture, gender had significant implications for military and diplomatic relations. Understood
    differently by each side, notions of kinship and proper masculine and feminine behavior wielded
    during negotiations had the power to either strengthen or disrupt alliances. The collision of
    different cultural expectations of masculine behavior and men&#39;s relationships to and
    responsibilities for women and children became significant areas of discussion and contention.
    Native American and British leaders frequently discussed issues of manhood (especially in the
    context of warfare), the treatment of women and children, and intermarriage. Women themselves
    could either enhance or upset relations through their active participation in diplomacy, war,
    and trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders invoked gendered metaphors and fictive kinship relations
    in their discussions, and by evaluating their rhetoric, &lt;i&gt; Brothers Born of One Mother
    &lt;/i&gt;investigates the intercultural conversations about gender that shaped Anglo-Indian
    diplomacy. LeMaster&#39;s study contributes importantly to historians’ understanding of the
    role of cultural differences in intergroup contact and investigates how gender became part of
    the ideology of European conquest in North America, providing a unique window into the process
    of colonization in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
