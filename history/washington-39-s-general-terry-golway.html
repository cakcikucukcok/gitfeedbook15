  <title>Washington&#39;s General - Terry Golway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The overlooked Quaker from Rhode Island who won the American Revolution&#39;s crucial southern campaign and helped to set up the final victory of American independence at Yorktown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathanael Greene is a revolutionary hero who has been lost to history. Although places named in his honor dot city and country, few people know his quintessentially American story as a self-made, self-educated military genius who renounced his Quaker upbringing-horrifying his large family-to take up arms against the British. Untrained in military matters when he joined the Rhode Island militia in 1774, he quickly rose to become Washington&#39;s right-hand man and heir apparent. After many daring exploits during the war&#39;s first four years (and brilliant service as the army&#39;s quartermaster), he was chosen in 1780 by Washington to replace the routed Horatio Gates in South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene&#39;s southern campaign, which combined the forces of regular troops with bands of irregulars, broke all the rules of eighteenth-century warfare and foreshadowed the guerrilla wars of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His opponent in the south, Lord Cornwallis, wrote, &quot;Greene is as dangerous as Washington. I never feel secure when I am encamped in his neighborhood. He is vigilant, enterprising, and full of resources.&quot; Greene&#39;s ingenious tactics sapped the British of their strength and resolve even as they &quot;won&quot; nearly every battle. Terry Golway argues that Greene&#39;s appointment as commander of the American Southern Army was the war&#39;s decisive moment, and this bold new book returns Greene to his proper place in the Revolutionary era&#39;s pantheon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Washington said if he went down in battle, Greene was his choice to succeed him. Read this book and you will understand why.&quot; -- Joseph J. Ellis, author of &lt;i&gt;His Excellency: George Washington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
