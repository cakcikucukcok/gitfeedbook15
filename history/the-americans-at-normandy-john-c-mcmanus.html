  <title>The Americans at Normandy - John C. McManus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Americans at D-Day&lt;/i&gt;, the first volume of this series, John C. McManus showed us the American experience in Operation Overlord. Now, in this succeeding volume, he does the same for the Battle of Normandy as a whole. Never before has the American involvement in Normandy been examined so thoroughly or exclusively as in &lt;i&gt;The Americans at Normandy&lt;/i&gt;. For D-Day was only one part of the battle, and victory came from weeks of sustained effort and sacrifices made by Allied soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented here is the American experience during that summer of 1944, from the aftermath of  D-Day to the slaughter of the Falaise Gap, from the courageous, famed figures of Bradley, Patton, and Lightnin&#39; Joe Collins to the lesser-known privates who toiled in torturous conditions for their country. What was this battle really like for these men? What drove them to fight against all sense and despite all obstacles? How and why did they triumph?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminiscent of Cornelius Ryan&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Longest Day&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Americans at Normandy &lt;/i&gt;takes readers into the minds of the best American strategists, into the hearts of the infantry, into hell on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engrossing, lightning-quick, and filled with real human sorrow and elation, The Americans at Normandy honors those Americans who lost their lives in foreign fields and those who survived. Here is their story, finally told with the depth, pathos, and historical perspective it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
