  <title>The It Book - Kathie Gedden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The IT Book is from my heart and much of it is from my life.
I think if there is any one thing that children of all ages need it is encouragement.  With this in mind I have written The IT Book   Short Stories of Encouragement for Children of All Ages.  I called it The IT Book because the stories are titled LISTEN TO IT, LOVE IT, EXPLORE IT, OVERCOME IT and so forth.
I never realized what an interesting life I have had until I wrote this book. I have always enjoyed words, languages and writing. Humor is a strong point in our family and I am happy to see my sense of humor coming out in some of these stories.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like our parents, I have always had a great appreciation for beauty in any form: in music, in words that uplift, in nature, and in the kindness in people which manifests in so many ways.
My husband, Bill Mercer, wrote several of these stories. I think you will find them delightful.
It is my hope and prayer that this little book will uplift you in some way.&lt;p&gt;" />
