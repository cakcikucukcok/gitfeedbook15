  <title>Dawn to Twilight: New and Selected Poems - Daniel Mark Epstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Drawing from a career of almost fifty years, Daniel Mark Epstein&#39;s collection of new and selected poems forms a lyrical autobiography of its author as a poet and a man. Dawn to Twilight examines universal themes such as love and aging, happiness and despair, each of which Epstein approaches differently throughout the decades of his writing career. These poems encapsulate the evolution of Epstein&#39;s work, with the passage of time itself forming a crucial theme as the author grows from student to lover to father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein&#39;s poems evince his deep empathy for people from all walks of life: a knife salesman who harbors no illusions about the use to which his wares have been put; a teacher who watches his student struggle with a thorny philosophical question; a genie whose plans of revenge fade as he emerges from his lamp into the light. Dawn to Twilight celebrates the coming of joy and beauty, accepts their transience, and elegizes their passing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
