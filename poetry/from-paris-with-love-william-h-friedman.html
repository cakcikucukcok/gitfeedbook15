  <title>From Paris with Love - William H. Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection includes poems from two weeks in Paris, Francewhere I and Mrs. Maguy Joseph visited for seven straight summers or seasons. Then there are also variety of poems about black/white race relations. 
The weeks these poems were done were gloomy and cold (in October that year). And rain bothered my arthritic right leg. Nonetheless, I feel the selection of poems were sufficient for this book. 
Even the October leaves hadnt turned color yet, as I had hoped for. But these problems seemed surmountable, why? Because I had my partner at home to think about while I was temporarily away. 
There are some other poems to fill out this selection too. A few are about the primary campaign between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. At the present time, I&#39;m working on poems with rhymed stanzas." />
