  <title>Church of the Red Arrow - Michael Houlihan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Church of the Red Arrow is a book about everything at once.  It is perfect for people with ADD or people who just get bored easily.  You can flip around in it all day like the yellow pages and always wind up home.  In this respect it is like the old saying that all roads lead to Mecca. It is poetry, fiction, and nonfiction with a section listing hundreds of unanswerable questions that are thought provoking and good topics of conversation.
There are also several short stories which start out linear and end up Joycian.  The book covers politics, poetry, and all sorts of paradoxes.  It is philosophical and sometimes just plain dumb.  I think you will find it an honest read: sometimes whimsical, sometimes seriously difficult, sometimes fusing an antithesis or two often just by accident--hence the conclusion that Lady Luck has smiled on this book. Your author has written three other volumes which could or could not hook up quite nicely with this one if everything in the world were a train. Mr. Houlihan is also a member of the Lefty Jones Band (but it is not his fault).  He refuses to play out or be seen in public." />
