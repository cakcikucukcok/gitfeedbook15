  <title>New Beginnings Poems - Nikolai Lisov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a one-of-a-kind. I guarantee you won&#39;t find a book like mine. The poems I write are from experiences or things I have seen in my life. I write my poems so my readers can understand a variety of emotions from a wide spectrum of circumstances. These poems encourage readers to look at a stuation from another&#39;s point-of-view. This second book is similar to my first book, Locked Up Poems, but it&#39;s all new material and represents the beginning of a new start. I was really excited fro writing my nre book because I want my readers to be happy as well as signify a new chapter in my life. At times, my poems can get sad or make you laugh. When I first started writing, it was just a hobby. Now, it&#39;s more than that. I try to help people based upon my experiences of what I have been through. I want my readers to understand that they are not alone in their experiences. Everyday is a new day and a new start." />
