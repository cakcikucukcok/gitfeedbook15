  <title>Divine Messages and Inspirations - Dr. Moses Anyanwu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The word of God declares in John 3:34 . . . . For he whom God sent speaketh the
words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him
The word of God declares that He has given us His Spirit without measure and
we often read this from the Prophetic books of the bible . . . . and the word of
the Lord came to me . . . .
The same God who spoke to the people of old, still speaks today to men and
women He has called.
This book Divine Messages and Inspiration is divine because these are
purely truths from the heart of God and it is inspired because these are direct
inspirations from the Holy Spirit to His servant Revd. Moses Anyanwu.
The author of this book is a man called by God who has been used by God
around the world, in conferences, Seminars, Revivals, church planting programs,
television and radio ministry, School of Ministries etc
As an Apostle of faith who believes in hearing and speaking what God says to
him anywhere at any time he is sensitive to what the Holy Spirit has to say to the
people of God. This book contains some of those words God spoke to him while
he was in the mission field ministering to people worldwide.
In his 23 years of full time ministry preaching around the globe the word of
faith from his mouth inspired by the Holy Spirit has blessed millions of people
though his televangelism program Hour of Grace and many have testimonies
of healing, deliverance and signs and wonders.
To God be the glory as you read this book you will be divinely inspired by the
Holy Spirit and blessed to do great things, Amen." />
