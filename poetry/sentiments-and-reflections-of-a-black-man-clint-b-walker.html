  <title>Sentiments and Reflections of a Black Man - Clint B. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book of poems were written in the attempt to get Gods message out, I had a
heavenly encounter with God and was taken out of body, mind or spirit I can not
really tell which but I know it was for the purpose of uniting all people for the
common good. Some of these poems deals with secular life and some are written
from a more spiritual venue but as Jesus use parables to explain the good and bad of
our actions so have I been instructed to do as well. When we dabble in things that
has no profi t only destruction then there is an equal reaction to all actions. These
words are the inspired works of God and will truly bless all that read them. They will
offer inspiration, courage, guidance and wisdom. If the reader keeps an open mind
and let the Holy spirit talk to their subconscious: Gods words do not go away into
the void but they accomplish what they are sent out to accomplish. This book will
have a universal appeal to all its readers and will give all readers a greater insight into
the mind of the author whom happens to be a black man, but more important a child
of God. Its purpose is to unite all races to come together as one people. There is
no difference between the Jew and Greek, bond nor free, for whosoever calls on the
name of the Lord will be saved. I profess we all are whosoever, whether red, yellow,
black, brown or white, we are all precious in Gods sight. Read these poems with an
open mind and a receptive heart and I guarantee you will be truly blessed by reading
them as I was blessed by writing them. May God bless all of his children with good
health, happiness and prosperity, is my hearts desire and prayer." />
