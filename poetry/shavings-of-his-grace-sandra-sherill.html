  <title>Shavings of His Grace - Sandra Sherill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Sandra Elaine Sherrill (Jefferson), currently a resident of St. Louis Missouri.
My Love for Poetry became my World away from the World surrounding me. When I write I feel as if Im able to dive inside the heart of my material &amp; come alive in ways that even I cannot fathom.  Ive had many family members and close friends encouraging my writings &amp; keeping me inspired.
Ive titled this Book  Shavings of Gods Grace, because overtime I feel God has graced my life in numerous ways with His love. Shavings are the hands that have a tendency to carve things off our lives in order to help us triumph over adversity. Shavings of Gods Grace,  lends its hand and helps to give us the strength, the hope, the faith we need to keep moving forward in the middle of a storm. As you read the material Ive penned you may find these writings areas that speak to areas in your very own lives. It is my hope that this material encourages, inspires and speaks to you in ways that will help uplift you to heights unknown.
My Love of Poetry is so dear to my heart it commemorates someone who is extremely vital to me, my dear Mother (Deceased).  Her strength, love and gentle ways of bringing comfort have been one of my biggest inspirations. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks and love in Honor of my Mothers Memory because she is my Diamond, my Ruby and my Heart.
I enjoy writing poetry and have enjoyed it since 1979. Since that time I&#39;ve shared my 
Love for Poetry at recitals, poetry group gatherings, on a television program with 
Channel 2 here in St. Louis - a program at that time called God&#39;s Musical World featured with Dr. Kenneth Billups (Deceased). 
It is my endeavor to encourage you my readers to allow the talents &amp; gifts you have to flourish as you accomplish what has been awarded to you. You are Destiny &amp; Design in its greatest hour of presentation &amp; art. I encourage you to write, sing, dance, paint, sketch, draw, take pictures, etc. Remember always to treasure your gifts and your talents. 
My love for Poetry has inspired me to start writing more each day &amp; it is my endeavor to fulfill my much needed Dream of having my material in print. Poetry has become a part of my very existence and has given me hope &amp; life through many trying times. Writing poetry has brought joy &amp; sunshine into my heart, many times it has inspired me to inspire others with their gifts &amp; talents.  I enjoy using this God-Given gift to inspire, uplift &amp; encourage you my readers.  Giving Glory to God Always for all that He has done for me.
 ~Blessings &amp; Love, to you my readers~" />
