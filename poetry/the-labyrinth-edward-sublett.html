  <title>The Labyrinth - Edward Sublett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Labyrinth is a word of pre-Greek Minoan origin referring to a maze with a defined path but without the dead ends and false passageways of a maze. Believed to have been constructed in Crete at Knosses, the labyrinth in the myth was constructed by Daedalus at the command of King Minos to imprison the Minotaur, to whom ten young men were sacrificed each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Labyrinth&lt;/i&gt;, author Edward Subletts new collection of poems, Sublett uses verse to reflect the temporary moments in our lives when we are lost, wondering what fate awaits usas he did when he nearly went blind due to detached retinas in both eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to evoking this time, the poems of this collection also recall the feeling of being by the sea and the other islands scattered south of mainland Greece, especially the islands that comprise Santorini, basking in the sun and the warmth of the Mediterranean Sea. Both themes come together to become &lt;i&gt;The Labyrinth&lt;/i&gt;, a poetry collection with a constant theme of lossof the temporary moments of our lives and of personal memoriesand of the understanding that we are all lost at some point in the Labyrinth awaiting our own personal Minotaur.&lt;/p&gt;
The sea passes over him, rises, falls, declines;&lt;/br&gt; 
the tide comes in, the full moon staring down,&lt;/br&gt; 
cold Dianas face reflected on the earth.&lt;/br&gt;
The moon is over an empty sea&lt;/br&gt;
and he dreams of another place&lt;/br&gt;
another voice and silence&lt;/br&gt;
He drinks saltwater in order to do what must be done&lt;/br&gt;
and madness overwhelms him&lt;/br&gt;
for he can swim no longer in the gentle tide&lt;/br&gt;
or wind blown sea&lt;/br&gt;
There is a star beyond the windowpane&lt;/br&gt;
he cannot touch, nor the sea with his eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;
