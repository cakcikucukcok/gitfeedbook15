&lt;b&gt;Note of Poem Acknowledgement from the President of the United States &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for your recent note, and for 
          sharing your thoughts with me.  Your kind words
          echo the messages of millions of Americans
          who have welcomed me and my family to the 
          White House with an outpouring of goodwill.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                On January 20th, Americans spoke with one
            voice, choosing hope over fear, unity of purpose 
            over conflict and discord.  Our Nation faces     
            serious challenges, but we will overcome them if 
            our imagination is joined to common purpose.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now is our time to work together, reaffirm
            our enduring spirit, and choose our better 
            history.  With your help, we will renew our 
            Nation&#39;s promise to carry forth the great gift of 
            freedom to our future generations, as our forebears 
            have delivered it to us." />
