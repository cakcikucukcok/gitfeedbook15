  <title>Blue Butterflies - Bernadeen Mitchell-Ghans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Bernadeen Mitchell-Ghans.  I reside in Maplewood, NJ with my husband and two children. I have been writing since the age of 17, and I write because I love to and it brings me peace. These poems or writings are the thoughts of my life as I experienced certain things. It is filled with thoughts of love, rage, friendships, and it tells of my physical and emotional pain from being in an abusive marriage to finding love in my current marriage and finally finding me. 
Every woman can feel something in these writings; whether it is struggling through a rocky relationship, being in an abusive relationship, and realizing that there is someone out there for everyone that can love them. Finally I ended this book with a thank you to my Veterans who I have served and have the utmost respect for and hope that they continue to persevere in order to succeed. I hope that they remember Motivation is the Key to Success!
These words are the Poems of My Life." />
