      <meta name="description" content="We wrote Shared Shoes to help people realize that no matter how tough life may be they are not alone.  We all share the same issues in life in some way  or fashion.  For example, We all have some kind of addiction rather it&#39;s alcoholism, drug abuse or something as simple as being a shop aholic.  These are all shared addictions amongst us as a whole from nation to nation.  No matter how rich you are or how poor you may be there is someone in this world that shares the same problems.
It is up to us to help our fellow man over come and rise above these issues that hold us prisoners of the mind.  We have to realize that we cannot and will not move forward without reaching out to each other for help.  We are all walking in shared shoes." />
