  <title>“Never Give Up” - Demetrius Belcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written while I was in jail from October 24, 2003, until January 4, 2005. I wrote these poems about my wife and how I felt about her and our marriage. I also wrote for other inmates to send to their ladies. As I wrote, I reflected on my mistakes and mostly on God. I wanted this book to capture the essence of true love and forgiveness. This book is about never giving up on anything you care about. Work hard at accomplishing your goals. Put your right foot forward as they say, but I say trust God and you can do all things through Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
