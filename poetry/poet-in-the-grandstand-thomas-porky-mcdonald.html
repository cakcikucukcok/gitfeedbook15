From his first trip in 1990, to the fabled Comiskey Park of Shoeless Joe Jackson, Bill Veeck and the Go-Go Sox, on through to the 2010 opening of Minnesotas fabulous Target Field, featuring the modern M&M Boys, Joe Mauer and Justin Mourneau, McDonald offers up a book that is part travelogue and part poetic tribute to all the places that men and women have gone to over the years for a very personal sense of joy. This journey, done methodically, over two decades, picks up steam as the chapters begin to flow. The effect of McDonald himself clearly growing as a poet through the years is accentuated by the fact that more and more pieces are written in the later trips. The end result is a most interesting volume of not just ballparks, but Americana, as numerous attractions taken in during those ballpark weeks and weekends are also noted and/or dissected.</p><p>For fourteen seasons on his own and then six more accompanied by friend and confidant Adam Boneker, McDonalds travels, highlighted by over 300 poems, can take the reader back to a simpler time or into the possibilities of the future.</p><p>In chapter and in verse, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Poet in the Grandstand</i> has something for both the baseball enthusiast and the curious traveler.
