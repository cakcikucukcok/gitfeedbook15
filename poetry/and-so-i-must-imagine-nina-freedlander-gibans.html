  <title>And so I Must Imagine - Nina Freedlander Gibans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="And So I must Imagine is about my sense of place and family heritage, my city as I reflect on its past, present and future. Families and friends, homes and second homes, and cities where one has lived most of a lifetime draw ones unique lifelines.  I lengthen my lifelines everyday.
&lt;p&gt;
[A Poem from the book]
Letters
There is something about opening an envelope
from a friend
written in hand
stained with a raindrop
slipped through the door
so the dog will not run out
barking and leaping.
&lt;p&gt;
I sit at the table
to read and reread.
I know the handwriting
read what I want to hear
say what I think
to myself, and
put it in my drawer
to season.
&lt;p&gt;
I will discover new words
tell you about friends who have missed you
give you that recipe I said I would send
plan as if tomorrow were yesterday
and you lived around the corner.
I will pick up the pieces that made us friends
and dust them off, gently." />
