  <title>Treasure of the Mind: A Tale of Redemption - J. Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the late summer months of 2000, on a cool dark night in the foothills of Boulder, Colorado, a seventeen year old boy was murdered by a young man he once considered his best friend. The calamity nearly crippled the boy&#39;s parents, especially the father who struggled mightily with grief, anger, and guilt. With the help of a very special elderly sage, the father of the boy struggled to survive the tragedy and recover from the heartbreaking ordeal. The story begins with the funeral of Michael&#39;s son, reveals the pain of a grief-stricken father on the verge of self-destruction, and ends with his redemption and return to a meaningful life. Michael is referred by a close friend to an elderly gentleman named Solomon. Solomon is a wise, irreverent, white-haired seer living in the small coastal village of Carlsbad, California where he teaches his own very special brand of spiritual therapy for lost souls. His office is a coffee shop and the beach where he and Michael meet and together try to find a way to recover Michael&#39;s lost life after his son&#39;s death. The relationship that develops between Michael and Solomon reaches a depth rarely found between two men." />
