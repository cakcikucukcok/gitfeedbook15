&lt;br&gt; Never think that you have lost a friend. My love and friend are of the same package. Give me my space to make mistakes, correct me, before it is too late.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Another day, another town, my new love, look at me now. Crazy in love one might say, I thought love, will never come my way.O n my own for many years, Money spent and I shed a lot of tears.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Sometimes feeling incomplete you still fulfi ll your needs. This love is for you and special things that he does. Yes, they come in all shapes and sizes, makes and models.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Its something about his smile that makes me unwind. I know friends have secrets habits and laughs. This is my love and he brings all of the above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Truthful from the start, he is a kid at heart. Our concerns and conservations are much more. A new love and start from the beginning to end. My Love and friend, dont say bad things, wish me well and let love begin. Im off to a new start You will always be in my heart.&lt;br&gt;
