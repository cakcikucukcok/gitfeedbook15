  <title>Wonders on My Wanders - Dr. Danesi Sadoh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I chose to use poetry as an art form to express my inner feelings, my surroundings and my experiences, I never knew how it will become an important part of my life. However, I found myself writing almost religously everyday for a year and the result is this anthology of poems.
Of course poetry takes different forms and its definition has provoked controversy since antiquity. Personally I see poetry as a synergy of words in a symbiotic relationship arranged sequentially and synchronously to produce a visual and mental aesthetic effect that may gladden the heart or provoke the mind into deep musings. 
Whatever the definition it is an art form available to almost everyone. The relative shortness of poems allows for the concentration of the deepest feelings in a potent and highly concentrated mix. I started writing this anthology following the deeply painful separation from my ex-wife and subsequent divorce. I wanted something cathartic more powerful than a simple diary to track and express my innermost fears, Love and sadness during the divorce process and this anthology was born. 
I was mainly influenced by the sonnets of William Shakespeare, the Odes of John Keats, the modernist romantic poems of Mihai Eminescu and lastly but not the least, the controversial poems of Charles Baudelaire.
I hope this poetical semi-autobiography, touches everyone that reads it in a personal way." />
