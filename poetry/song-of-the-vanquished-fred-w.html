  <title>Song of the Vanquished - Fred W.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world is not perfect; in his newest poetry collection, &lt;i&gt;Song of the Vanquished,&lt;/i&gt; author Fred W. Herman presents a series of verses that explore these imperfections.
Employing end rhyme in many of the selections, the haunting themes speak to the injustices of war, hatred, death, prejudice, bigotry, and evil. The poem The Perfect Excuse tackles intolerance and hate:
&lt;i&gt;The Perfect Excuse
If their looks are not like ours, 
We are compelled to hate them. 
And if their gods are different, 
We are advised to kill them. 
And if their hair should be more curly, 
Or their chests appear more burly, 
That will make them different. 
So we go out and kill them. 
And if their speech keeps us perturbed 
For hours, 
Or their manners are not like ours, 
That will make them different. 
So we set out to kill them. 
And when some writers books are different, 
The mobs are urged to hate them. 
For writers are not like us, 
So the mobs are urged to lynch them. &lt;/i&gt;" />
