  <title>That Was Then, This Is Now - Branford L. Moton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="That Was Then This Is Now; is a book that is basically about my trials
and tribulations through mid-high school, teen years; and all the way up
to now; as a young adult.
It describes my life situation in general. This book deals with depression,
darkness, spirituality, love, drama, hope and encouragement.
I pray that it will uplift peoples lives and give them the perseverance that
they need to cope with any personal issues in their life.
I want it to aspire or inspire people like me and in general. I just want to
make a difference in someones life.
I want to cause a reaction in other lives; like the movie Pay it forward." />
