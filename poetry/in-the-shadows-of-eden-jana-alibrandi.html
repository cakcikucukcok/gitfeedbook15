  <title>In the Shadows of Eden - Jana Alibrandi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;In the Shadows of Eden&lt;/i&gt; is a lyrical collection of poetry that evokes emotion and reminds us that we as humans all sin and yet are still able to find a common beauty in lifes experiences through spiritual growth. Jana Alibrandi captivates our attention and souls with her heartfelt and beautiful verse.  From the title poem, Fallen Petals in the Shadows of Eden, to Candy Eyes Dont Lie, her poetry has been called insightful and edgy, while it describes a life of both sin and spiritual bliss. 
Her poetry relates to human experiences, and through them we are strengthened. She believes that we are all sinners in the shadows of Eden, as we come to an understanding of spiritual growth that blossoms with integrity. 
&lt;i&gt;Fallen Petals in the Shadows of Eden
The walls decay in a bloody cave
Love for a century is countless in days
Lies feel longer than an eternity
Does the term loyalty apply?	
Why, when all I do is share
The petal of deceit
This broken chair has had its last sway
This wooden shamble is not mine &lt;/i&gt;" />
