      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is a continuous poem. As the poems continue, so does the journey. One day, the journey led him to a fork in the roadone sign pointing to the world and the other sign to the way, the truth, and the life. He is still on the road he took leading to the way, the truth and the life. However, a strange thing happened on this journey. The road he took led him through the world. But he was not afraid. Having seen the world through his eyes, he was now seeing it through the eyes of God. Having seen today, he could see tomorrow. Oh sure, he stumbled and he fell, but there was always a hand reaching out to pick him up and brush him off. There was always a smile that told him he was loved. These pages are the poems of his journey, one that continues still. Maybe its yours.&lt;/p&gt;" />
