  <title>Another Day Someday - Tracey Odessa Kane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Tracey Odessa Kane comes another book of poetry with a purpose - that purpose being to wake us from the sleep of daily life. Another Day Someday seeks to teach people how to think for themselves, as opposed to telling them what to think. It is a spotlight, one that aims to shed light and bring out into the open that which has been brushed under society&amp;rsquo;s carpet for far too long. The road to Another Day Someday, though not elusive (not by any means), is still considered to be a bridge too far, a wish upon a star, that is simply out of reach for many. It is a road that is heavily laden with dreams and doubt, gain and guilt, promise and procrastination, hope and heartache. It is a road that we all long to tread upon, a road overflowing with purpose, passion, promise. It is a road unlike any other, a road upon which you can hear the overwhelming sound of 7 billion voices asking in whispered tones that age old question, &amp;ldquo;what if, if only.&amp;rdquo; If you did ask poet Tracey Odessa Kane about that road, she&amp;rsquo;d say that one day, maybe Another Day Someday, we will all find the love, the strength and the courage to walk upon it together as friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
