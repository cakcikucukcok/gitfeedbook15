  <title>Your Life Through My Eyes - Mary Pourch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This short story targets the lives of two best friends, who are also neighbors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Both ladies (Wanda and K) have sons who are also the best of friends. These two young ladies both have live-in boyfriends who are not their kids fathers. K&#39;s man (Velt) cheated on her in the past, and its something thats hard for her to forget, although Wanda wants her friend to be more forgiven of him in their almost perfect relationship because she knows that Velt is a real farther to his family, and he loves her son deeply.
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wandas man (Jake) use to be a homebody, she met when he was on vacation; he fell in love with her and decided to stay in town. Wanda took it to her advantage that he didnt know too many people in town, so she continued to hang out, leaving him home to baby-sit her son many nights. K wants Wanda to stop being so careless with her male friends, and to pay more attention to her present relationship before her man leaves her for good. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These two friends spend a lot of time together shopping, talking on the phone, or just hanging out with the kids. K becomes pregnant and is unsure if she should have a baby
from a man who cheated on her before. After a long conversation with her boyfriend and a lot of forgiveness, K decides to keep the baby. She shares her news with another good friend of hers, who agrees with Wanda about the love Velt has for her and her son. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The almost sudden death of a male friend, leaves K upset and confused, but Wanda is right there by her side to comfort her though it all, she even flys out of town with K to attend the funeral and meet his family for the first time.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Soon after they returned to town, the tables are quickly turned, and now its Wanda who needs love and support from her best friend. K support and encourage Wanda to live, she
convinces her to fight for her life, her son, her strength, and most of all their friendship, because she doesnt want to loss her best friend. Together they learn to live each day as it comes, no matter what it bring; and trust me, it brings unbelievable surprises." />
