  <title>Darling - Jackie Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Humour, gender, sexuality, sensuality, identity, racism, cultural difference: when do any of these things ever come together to equal poetry? When Jackie Kay&#39;s part of the equation. Darling brings together into a vibrant new book many favourite poems from her four Bloodaxe collections, &quot;The Adoption Papers&quot;, &quot;Other Lovers&quot;, &quot;Off Colour&quot; and &quot;Life Mask&quot;, as well as featuring new work, some previously uncollected poems, and some lively poetry for younger readers. Kay&#39;s poems draw on her own life and the lives of others to make a tapestry of voice and communal understanding. The title of her acclaimed short story collection, &quot;Why Don&#39;t You Stop Talking&quot;, could be a comment on her own poems, their urgency of voice and their recognition of the urgency in all voice, particularly the need to be heard, to have voice. And what voice -- the voices of the everyday, the voices of jazz, the voices of this many-voiced United Kingdom.&lt;/div&gt;" />
