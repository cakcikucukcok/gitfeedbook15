&lt;p&gt;- Terry Hutchinson, America&#39;s Cup Skipper and Tactician, 2008 Rolex Yachtsman of the Year, six-time World Champion and father of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Melissa Deveney has managed to mesh ancient Eastern wisdom with insights and metaphors associated with becoming more attuned in sailing and in life.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Dr. Tim Herzog, Licensed Counselor and Mental Skills Coach at Reaching Ahead, Former Head Coach at Boston College Sailing Team and self-proclaimed &quot;nerd&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only does this book insight a reevaluation of our world view... it suggests independent lenses through which life experience can be assessed as they are allowed to influence our own sense of self.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- William Mace, Retired Director of Electronics at NASA during the &quot;Space Race&quot;, designer of the X-15 nose cone (the first of its kind to self-correct flight trajectory) and devoutly active member of the Episcopal Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Melissa Deveney has written an easy to read, thoughtful book that is a must read for all competitive sailors. By following these concepts a sailor will excel using the mind to handle any situation the wind, water or competition throws at you. These helpful ideas should be reviewed before any major race.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gary Jobson, President of US Sailing, America&#39;s Cup Champion, US Sailing Hall of Fame Member, Author, ESPN Commentator, Emmy Winner and Lymphoma Survivor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
