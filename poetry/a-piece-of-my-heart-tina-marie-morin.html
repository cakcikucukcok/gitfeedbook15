  <title>A Piece of My Heart - Tina Marie Morin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The suggestion that anyone different should feel shame is implied in nearly every aspect of our lives.    There is so much pressure placed on us to conform in terms of personality and self expression it is easy to forget our God given talents and the uniqueness that sets us apart as individuals.  Sometimes the cost of self control is simply too high.  Finding the balance where you honor yourself and others is a constant struggle.  Since my mother passed I have felt her presence with me.  She was such a creative woman and the strength she showed in living her life is still an inspiration.  I learned from her to keep putting one foot in front of the other and to persevere to be the best that I can be.  I wish you many blessings and the peace only God can give." />
