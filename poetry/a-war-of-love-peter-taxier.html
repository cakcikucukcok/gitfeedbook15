  <title>A War of Love - Peter Taxier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first two sections of this book, Poems and Pretty and the Rascals, were written by the author in 1982 and 1983. The Humorous and the Melancholy was written in 2014. The other three works and the additional poems were all written in 2015.
I started writing poems in 1982 because of panic attacks and because I wanted to reach out and touch someone, as the saying goes. This publishing effort, which is financed by me, is an additional effort to reach out to people. My poems are pretty poems, humorous poems, and spiritual poems primarily. The original work was compiled into booklets. The six booklets I compiled and had printed out, ten to fifteen poems to a booklet, were as follows:
Poems, by William T. Elliott
The Pretty and the Rascals, Poems by William T. Elliott
The Humorous and the Melancholy, Poems by William T. Elliott
A War of Love, Poems by William T. Elliott
Peace, Poems by William T. Elliott
Reverence, Poems by William T. Elliott
Since he had completed the last set, Reverence, the author had finished six more poems, which are in the section &quot;Additional Poems.&quot;" />
