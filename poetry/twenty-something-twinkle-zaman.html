  <title>Twenty Something - Twinkle Zaman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its not easy being a twentysomething. Were curious, hungry, and have a deep burning desire to give our dreams light. Its a time of self-discovery and finding out who we are, what were meant to do, and what our purpose is in this life. Were continually being told we can do and accomplish anything we want in this life, but its easy to dream and hard to make that dream a reality when were stuck in a job cycle, trying to get a degree, or just to keep up with life in general. Im with you, and I am where you are. Im just another twentysomething-year-old trying to figure how to make my dreams a reality. In my collection of poetry, I touch on a little bit of everythingfeeling stuck, the observations we make growing up, love, girl power, and chasing dreams. I hope you find a little bit of yourself in my book and know that you arent alone. I hope you find it in yourself to be fearless and determined to live out your dreams someday. Maybe taking the chance sometimes actually works out. Im still figuring it out." />
