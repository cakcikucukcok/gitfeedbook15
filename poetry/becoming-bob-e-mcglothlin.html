  <title>Becoming! - Bob E. McGlothlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BECOMING!
A piece of canvas becomes a work of art
Once the artist makes his final mark.
A piece of stone becomes a sculpture
Once the sculptor chips away the last chip.
For a poet,
A plain piece of paper becomes a priceless gem
Once he finally lifts his pen.
God is the artist
That&#39;s painting beauty within the heart of our soul.
God is the sculptor.
That&#39;s chipping away at the flaws in our character
To make us into His perfect image.
God is the poet
That would turn the plainness of our lives
Into poetic praise.
Contained within this volume are words of prose
that were written while in the process of becoming.
