  <title>Commonsense Capsules - Tara Thorat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The biggest tests are in the arena of life--that is where you ultimately succeed or fail. Every decision we make has a lifelong impactfor good or bad. Errors are difficult to reverse and carry a huge price tag. Making correct decisions needs common sense i.e. a mix of knowledge, introspection, self awareness, general awareness, and foresight ---all of which are generally acquired late in life. 
Common sense is the outcome of experience carefully passed through the prism of thought. What emerges is a spectrum of insights and home truths that remove confusion and ignorance. Common sense clears mental, emotional fog and gives us the right perspectives to see things in context. Common sense helps one see the bigger picture.
Tara Thorat shares these insights on critical traits and issues of everyday life as one wayfarer with another prodding us to develop the skill of conscious living through conversations with self-- so that we can emerge stronger and wiser through the tests of life. 
What distinguishes this book from other self help books is the compactness.  a lot of content is packed into just a few lines. This makes it a quick and easy reference book.
One need not read the whole book to find an input on some concept or issue. Whenever there are minutes to spare just open to the relevant page and start the dialogue.
