  <title>The Poems of T. S. Eliot Volume II: Practical Cats and Further Verses - T. S. Eliot, Christopher Ricks, Jim McCue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Poems of T. S. Eliot&lt;/i&gt; is the authoritative edition of one of  our greatest poets, scrupulously edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim  McCue. It provides, for the first time, a fully scrutinized text of  Eliot&#39;s poems, carefully restoring accidental omissions and removing  textual errors that have crept in over the full century in which Eliot  has been so frequently printed and reprinted.  The edition also presents  many poems from Eliot&#39;s youth which were published only decades later,  as well as others that saw only private circulation in his lifetime, of  which dozens are collected for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accompany  Eliot&#39;s poems, Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue have provided a  commentary that illuminates the creative activity that came to  constitute each poem, calling upon drafts, correspondence and other  original materials to provide a vivid account of the poet&#39;s working  processes, his reading, his influences and his revisions.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first volume respects Eliot&#39;s decisions by opening with his &lt;i&gt;Collected Poems 1909-1962&lt;/i&gt;  in the form in which he issued it, shortly before his death fifty years  ago.  There follow in this first volume the uncollected poems from his  youth that he had chosen to publish, along with such other poems as  could be considered suitable for publication.  The second volume opens  with the two books of poems of other kinds that he issued, &lt;i&gt;Old Possum&#39;s Book of Practical Cats&lt;/i&gt; and his translation of Perse&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Anabase&lt;/i&gt;,  moving then to verses privately circulated as informal or improper or  clubmanlike. Each of these sections is accompanied by its respective  commentary, and then, pertaining to the entire edition, there is a  comprehensive textual history recording variants both manuscript and  published. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Poems of T. S. Eliot&lt;/i&gt; is a work of  enlightening scholarship that will delight and inform all those who read  Eliot for pleasure, as well as all those who read with pleasure and for  study. Here are a new accuracy and an unparalleled insight into the  marvels and landmarks from &lt;i&gt;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Waste Land&lt;/i&gt; through to &lt;i&gt;Four Quartets&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
