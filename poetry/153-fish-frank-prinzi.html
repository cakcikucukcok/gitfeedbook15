When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just caught. So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. Now none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? They knew it was the Lord.&lt;br/&gt;
John 21:9-12&lt;br/&gt;
(ESV)&lt;p/&gt;
Our Father in heaven has put eternity into the hearts of all human beings. We are made to think deeply and hard work is our reward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p/&gt;There are certain things that prosaic language cannot express, and certain places where poetry acts as a zealous guide in our eternal longing and search.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p/&gt;153 fish is intended to point to the One for whom the entire universe awaits with a groaning too deep for wordsthe Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&lt;p/&gt;
153 fishpoetry to refresh, remind, and revive; an enrichment to your devotional time.&lt;br /&gt;
to Him be glory forever.&lt;p/&gt;
