  <title>Spoken Medicine - Gabrielle Journey Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Gabe Journey Jones&amp;rsquo;s poetry uniquely combines words and rhythm into recipes for healing, conversing and connecting with ourselves and one another. Her libretti are astute, set to bars, accents, BPM (beats per minute) and broken-up beats; they pulsate like the sanctuary of a mother&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat and become&amp;nbsp;Spoken Medicine.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Friederike Krishnabhakdi-Vasilakis, Director, South Coast Writers Centre, writer and facilitator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Passionate, percussive poetry written for performance that slams complacency and oppression with urgency and compassion. She&amp;rsquo;s a priestess, exhilarating incantations heard accompanied by her drumming, divines the hidden and can heal a sick society. This is a magical potion.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Jenni Nixon, poet, writer and mentor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Gabrielle&amp;rsquo;s collection of poetry is dazzling in its scope and intensity. The medicine gets to all the neglected parts of ourselves. Readers are in for a thought-provoking treat. It is wonderful that the world of spoken word is graced by a poet of such fierce integrity and poetic vitality.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Wilfred C. Roach, poet, writer and performer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I love nothing more than a fierce woman unafraid to speak loud truths, a counter voice to the dominant narratives which are not necessarily the real narratives. Gabe is all of that and more. This collection will certainly light a fire in your belly and spark something in your heart.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Candy Royalle, artivist, writer, poet, storyteller and performance artist&lt;/p&gt;" />
