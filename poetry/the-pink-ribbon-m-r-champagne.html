  <title>The Pink Ribbon - M.R. Champagne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book of collected poetry, art work, and a short story that started about twelve years ago.  The poetry started with a simple muse.  A thought that required no thought what-so-ever.  The inspiration and the desire started with a girl sitting in the same classroom, later writing became a pleasant way to pass the time. 
The art work started with a severe case of writers block, which lead to drawing lines on paper.  It isnt really supposed to look like anything, just whatever is seen in the eye of the beholder.
The short story came about from the passing of someone that was dear to the heart.  A grandma, who prayed every day for a grandson she barely even knew.  The Pink Ribbon is a short story about a little girl with a pink ribbon tied in her hair, fear, and death.
There are two wishes that are made with this book.  Helping those with cancer is the first.  Weather it is the treatment, care, or cure.  A percentage of the authors proceeds will go to helping those that suffer from cancer.  The second wish is helping the author find The Muse; the girl, who is now a woman, which first inspired and encouraged him to write over a decade ago." />
