  <title>Hearing Heart - Oludotun Fajorin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The young cripple sat on the floor of the railway station, waiting earnestly for the train to come and take him to the land of plenty. Crippled from birth, he hadn&#39;t nobody or helper. Deep inside his heart, he needed a miracle. 
He knew the desire to move on to the land of freedom. His eyes moved to and fro the railway station, patiently he waited. His eyes fixed on the future. &quot;It shall come to past,&quot; he assured his soul. 
He hadn&#39;t any ticket, yet he waited, hoping for an unseen miracle, then, his faith grew strong. &quot;I need to go home,&quot; he assured himself again. 
From a distance, he saw the train coming. Suddenly, a twinkle of an eye, then his determined heart grew weary. He loses his focus. &quot;I have no money, I can&#39;t get on this train,&quot; he reminded himself. He doubted and turned to leave in disappointment. Painfully he slowly crippled back home regrettably and looking pale. 
Just in time along the way, as he crippled home, he met another younger cripple going toward the same train. Excitedly the younger cripple asked him, &quot;Are you not supposed to be on that train going to the land of plenty?&quot; 
&quot;Uhm . . . yes, but I&#39;m going back home because I have no ticket,&quot; he replied. 
Then passionately the younger cripple gave a silent whisper to his ears, &quot;Two angels of light found me, they told me you are here waiting for me,&quot; he said. Then he brought out a folded handkerchief and unfolded it. Then he said, &#39;&#39;Here are our tickets, I am sorry I came a little bit late, I needed to pay off my debt before departing this city. He handed over his ticket to him and gave him a kiss and pulled him toward the train. 
Happily, the younger cripple said &quot;I have gotten the hearing heart&quot; and started his way back gently, and they got on the train. 
To all who are downcast, you will find love and grace; thus, this book was inspired to affect your whole life positively." />
