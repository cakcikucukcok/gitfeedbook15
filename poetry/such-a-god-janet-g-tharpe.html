  <title>Such a God - Janet G. Tharpe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Tharpe brings these ancient stories into the present moment for me. I found them powerful as well as provocative. The title seems to give a much broader lens to the vision of Source including all sentient beings which touches my soul deeply.
-Wendy Jo Johnson, LPCC 
Therapist/Artist/Writer/Seeker
Tharpe offers a rehearing and resetting of biblical stories that are praise and provocation, full of humor, questions, anguish and faith. These prose poems will open you up. I commend them most highly to you. 
-H. Stephen Shoemaker, 
retired pastor, author of several books, including, 
Godstories: New Narratives from Sacred Texts
Tharpes voice emerges and resonates with a sense of being present in each storys moment. This is no small thing. It is incarnational activity.
-Lou Ann Iler, 
professional artist/teacher
I have never been interested in poems; however, after reading a few of these, I was enthralled.
