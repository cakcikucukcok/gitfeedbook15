  <title>Leaving Woodstock by Walking Backwards - C. J. Krieger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In C.J.s poetry (as with his other books) you will find music, along with sadness, healing, joy, comedy, erotica, melancholy, pain, love and inspiration. His poems embrace all those facets of human life that we share. C.J.s poems also have a way of drawing the reader in, a way in which the reader can identify with the author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So settle down comfortably, put your feet up and read but dont stop there. In a few weeks time, or next year, read those poems again. You will find that they grow with each reading. Eventually, over time, sooner or later, in the long run, you will see them blossom and become even more beautiful and more meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure they will move you as much as they do me.&lt;/p&gt;
