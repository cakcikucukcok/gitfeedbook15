  <title>Purge - Denise Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Purge: A True Story is my real life story. I began to write poems and quotes again after having years of trials and tribulations. Painfully, they put me into a great transition of life while in my midforties. After being a devoted wife and mother for years, Im now a divorced, single woman, who has raised two grown sons. I decided to search for my position in my lifes journey. Although Ive experienced many heartbreaking issues, I also have plenty of happy days. These happy days allowed me to regroup. Putting my story on paper, in poetic form, helped me to reflect, rejuvenate, and release it all in order to keep pressing forward. So what unfolds in the pages of this book is the truth of me. But sometimes, this is how life can be. Im giving God the glory for allowing me to survive these storms. My happy days have given me encouragement to share my stories in the form of my quotes and happy poems." />
