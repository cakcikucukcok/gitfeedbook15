&lt;p&gt;Do You See the Roses?&lt;/p&gt;
Do you see the roses?&lt;/br&gt;
Inhale their sickly sweet perfumes.&lt;/br&gt;
Grasp their lush, silky petals and their piercing thorns.&lt;/br&gt;
Do you watch them hour by hour, in silence, as they wait for an unsuspecting victim to puncture?&lt;/br&gt;
Tick tock, tick.&lt;/br&gt;
Tick tock, tick.&lt;/br&gt;
Their time is growing scarce.&lt;/br&gt;
Do you spy the midnight sparrows?&lt;/br&gt;
Catch their fierce battle cries.&lt;/br&gt;
Sniff the rotting decay of their aching souls.&lt;/br&gt;
Do you watch them wither slowly before death reaches out and snatches them in its cold, dark fingers?&lt;/br&gt;
Tick tock,&lt;/br&gt;
Tick.&lt;/br&gt;
Their time is running out.&lt;/br&gt;
Do you behold the trees?&lt;/br&gt;
Evade their colorless leaves?&lt;/br&gt;
Take in their sacred whispers swept away by the never-ending breeze.&lt;/br&gt;
Watch them sway at the strike of an axe, before tumbling down with a deadly finality.&lt;/br&gt;
Tick tock.&lt;/br&gt;
Their time is trickling by.&lt;/br&gt;
Do you perceive the apples?&lt;/br&gt;
Taste the deadly poison within.&lt;/br&gt;
Ignore the rotten portion in a crumpled heap beneath your feet.&lt;/br&gt;
Do you watch them wither, turning black within until their once fresh, juicy core has gone dry?&lt;/br&gt;
Tick.&lt;/br&gt;
Their time has almost gone.&lt;/br&gt;
Do you see the humans?&lt;/br&gt;
Taste the blood lingering in the frosty silence.&lt;/br&gt;
Hear the rustle of fabric as they turn against each other?&lt;/br&gt;
Do you watch them drive their companions to death with their cruelties strung up like a banner of pride?&lt;/br&gt;
Silence.&lt;/br&gt;
Their time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
