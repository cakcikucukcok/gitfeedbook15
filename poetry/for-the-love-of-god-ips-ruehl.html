  <title>For the Love of God - Ips Ruehl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book of original writings of verse found in the book titled: Buried in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original thought to put these writings into book form has been a positive and negative thought process for over sixteen years. A deliberate determination of habit change and a renewable force has re-entered my being that has almost given me the assignment of completing my journey of the unseen, unknown, path, or segment of my life. I held the secret within me. The feeling of peace is a source element that cannot be explained only known and God given. To me, Gods peace is, Gods other word for love, and just as important. You can have love, and not have peace within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming pages of writings, verses, are not in rotation, no particular order. I have been unable to put them into any sequence of time written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my belief that the story Buried in my heart will be found to be interesting An aspect of curiosityA dilemma of a life lived For The Love of God, what does that exactly mean?&lt;/p&gt;" />
