  <title>I Am From... - Marsha Forbes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am from is a compilation of student poetry, written by students from several schools within the Peel District School Board from grades 4-8. This book was inspired by an Identity unit, where as a component, my grade 8 class created &quot;I Am From&quot; poems. The diverse voices highlighted through these poems were refreshing - like a little &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot;.  With the voice of diversity so pronounced, it seemed fitting to support our newcomers by dedicating one hundred percent of the proceeds from this book toward providing backpacks for newcomers within the Peel District School Board. Presently, Peel is proud to be the fastest growing immigrant population in Canada. The idea was shared with other schools within our board, and the teachers and students responded to the opportunity, resulting in this &quot;I am From...&quot; compilation that we share with you today.
