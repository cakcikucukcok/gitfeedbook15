  <title>Adventures in Alliteration - Joel L. Meredith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Words are wonderful, wacky. wise, winsome things to use. Sometimes seemingly senseless, sometimes soulful or sorrowful, sometimes spiritual or soulish, and sometimes startling, strengthening, sarcastic, sinful, or soul winning. Words are used in many ways and have many faces, fonts, facets, fortes, factions, flavors, and fans. Use them carefully for they can hurt to the quick, encourage to be quick, quicken the spirit, soothe the sorrowful, and confuse the illiterate.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The paragraph above is an example of alliteration run rampant. So run, rally, reiterate, read, and return. Alliterative poems, short stories, and pithy proverbs in this book abound with humor, social comment, and even silliness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you want a laugh, a jolt, or just a smile, you need to curl up with this book and get ready for the unexpected. Its not a childrens book, but its rated fun.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Heres a couple of examples&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bruce Sturgess bought string beans and stuffed broiled sirloin before sending Bryan Scott, burdened somewhat, back soon for baked swordfish. Bruce smiled beamingly, seemingly, because swordfish brought some bright, sweet memories to mind.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before Sandra Beavers split, Bruce and Sandra both savored baked swordfish. Bittersweet but soothing memories of being sweethearts bloomed somewhere in Bruces soul. Sandra Beavers stood, built sweetly, built solid, built slender, built sprightly, bust size beautiful and sensual.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Besides stirring Bruce Sturgess best stuff between Bruces strong legs, Sandra brought sensations to brighten Sturgess brain. Somewhat better since breaking up, Sturgess became sadly bewildered sometimes, but soon Bruce would bite swordfish again, and Bryans smile would brighten Sturgess beautiful suite on Boston Street.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bitter soon after Sandras brother stiffed Bruce and Bruce stuffed Sandras brother into a blue suit, a big sack, and a black Studebaker, Sandra broke with Sturgess and stomped back to South Burbank steaming and bristling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Better start being sensible, Bruce Sturgess, said Bruce to himself, seconds before smartly backing into a Buick Skylark.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Buck Smothers burst from the Skylark and busted Sturgess on Bruces suntanned beak. Big, stupid, backward, stunted, brainless student of bashing standing Buicks! screamed Buck.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Be still! said Bruce. Some bystander, stand by for something beautiful!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bruce stood before Smothers, and, before some could blink, struck Buck with several blows. Smothers, bruised and somewhat bloody, slowly bowed and sank to the busy sidewalk. A bit stupid, Buster! said Bruce.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Later, after settling business, Sturgess, Bryan Scott, and Buck Smothers began eating swordfish between solemn bodyguards. The bodyguards were protecting Bryan Scott, because it was Scotts bundles and such that blocked Sturgess back window and contributed to the bruised Skylark.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Anyway, Bruce Sturgess, Bryan Scott, and Buck Smothers, bellies stretched by swordfish, BSd the night away.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But whats the difference? This is all BS anyway!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;COMMENT&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the forgoing piece, paired words, one beginning with B, one with S, are used for the alliterative effect. In the following piece, alliteration is achieved by the more direct traditional approach almost all of the words begin with the letter M.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MUSKETS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Misfired muskets mutilate millions. Must muskets multiply? Maybe muskets might make mommy miserable, but must masses be miffed? Muskets make moose huntable. Moose meat makes mighty fine eating! Moose might be merry without muskets, but musketeers might go hungry without muskets. Might a moose be misused because of muskets? Mounts and muskets make might, and me being mighty makes me militant. Mark my words, muskets must not be withheld from the masses, minorities maybe, Mormons for sure. Muskrats may multiply without using muskets to maintain a manageable balance. Missed making my mark because of my missing" />
