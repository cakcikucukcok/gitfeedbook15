Sit for a moment ... grab a cup of tea or coffee, open this book and read about:
The power of jigsaw puzzles
Why the old man sits on the porch  
What the moon whispers
See the saxophone tones
Immerse yourself in the misty morning
Meet wacky Basketown characters
Find out what you might see on a solitary country road
See your soul in ripples of faith
Experience Jim Crow through the eyes of a child
Add these ingredients to your simmering stew
Chuckle at the Fat Cat&#39;s tribute to Dr. Seuss
Gain a whole new perspective on maggots
Hear my great-great grandmother&#39;s message
Taste, inhale and feel the rainbow.
Decide if you would drink the witch&#39;s brew
Learn what kind of light isn&#39;t a light
Enter into the powerful chapter of Fire Shadows, or cool yourself in the chapter of Water Visions.  Yes ... it&#39;s all in here, and more!  Written in free-verse rhymed and non-rhymed, rhyming couplets, haiku, senyru, narrative, rhyming quatrains, blank verse, limericks and other forms." />
