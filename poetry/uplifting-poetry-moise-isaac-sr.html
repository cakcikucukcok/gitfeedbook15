  <title>Uplifting Poetry - Moise Isaac Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Reading can be dull, or exciting depending on what article or book you are reading. This book Uplifting Poetry is different, because each poem
        describes what happen to people and the circumstances surrounding certain events in their lives. You can easily relate to them. When facing hardships,
        trials and suffering some folk will put their trust in God, while others will not. You can emulate the good behavior of a person whose lifes story is
        told in the bible. As God intervenes in a miraculous way to rescue him, likewise he is able to do it for you if you request His help.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The death of Jesus on the cross demonstrates love that we will never be able to penetrate. When you read those poems, you will not be fearful of
        tomorrow, knowing that your future is in Gods hands. Words you utter can get you sometimes into deep trouble. This book encourages you to keep your
        tongue under control, and to think before you talk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        A neighbor in need is a neighbor in need. Too often we fail to help a friend or a stranger in need. There is a poem in this book that will make you
        change your attitude toward other human beings. After reading it, you will become more loving, tender and compassionate. Whether your believe it or not
        your pilgrimage here below will end soon. Living in the heavenly places should be your ultimate desire.
    &lt;/p&gt;
