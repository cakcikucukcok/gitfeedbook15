  <title>Voice&#39;s Daughter of a Heart Yet To Be Born - Anne Waldman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Coming in the wake of her vast and magnificent epic (&lt;I&gt;The Iovis Trilogy: Colors in the Mechanism of Concealment&lt;/I&gt;), this volume brings Anne Waldman&amp;#8217;s work into the more intimate, paradoxical folds of poetic (and prophetic) knowledge. This should not suggest that&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Voice&#39;s Daughter of a Heart Yet to Be Born&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;is a book of small things; it is anything but. Juxtaposing lyric arcana,&amp;#160;journalism, critical fragments, visions of mythic and mystic beings, narrative, polemics, and even ekphrasis, Waldman has created a work that is simultaneously jeremiad and psalm.

Thel who talks with worm. Thel a figment in the mind of becoming-in-life, of potential, of not-becoming-yet in-mind, just got dreamed up, a proposal is Thel&#39;s gambit for one who would be cautious.
