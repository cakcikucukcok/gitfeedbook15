  <title>Eludoran - Jonathan Goh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In time one shall be hailed a king,
another as Betrayer.
Their third shall do an evil thing
when freedom is denied her.
Now Four and Five shall not survive;
misfortune  Six to gain
by Sevens will at least until
reunion on the Plain.
Though seven heroes journey forth;
prepare their final stand,
not all; I fear, shall chance to peer
upon their journeys end.
Three children will seal the fate of nations: Lorelei the rebel vixen princess of Eludoran; measured against the yardstick of her heroic brother. Malachi her sidekick and cousin; resigned to mull over a love he can never have. And exotic Pendarynn; son of a jealous sorceress driven mad by revenge. 
Their paths cross in Eludoran, where they find solace with each other. Little do their feuding parents suspect whats been going under their noses; a friendship the like of which has never been heard of before: One which might shatter old grudges and usher in a new age of tolerance and reason... 
--or bring everything crashing down around them." />
