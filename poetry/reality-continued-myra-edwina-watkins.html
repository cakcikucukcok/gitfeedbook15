  <title>Reality Continued - Myra Edwina Watkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The collection of poems and short stories written in poetic form in this book, are of inspired events and experiences.
These writings  also speaks of a lot of emotional struggles and pain.  A facing of realities.  I wish that I had all &quot;Good&quot;
things to share, but that is not reality.  Life is full of ups and downs, good and not so good.  There is a wealth of experiences
and situations and events that can and did happen.  Many will relate, and many will not.  Some will absolutely love it, and 
some will not...That is Reality.  
     Most of what you read here is good reading.  It can allow us to look inside ourselves. Many could possibly say,  &quot;I know
those feelings&quot;..&quot;I have felt like that before&quot;.. &quot;Ive experienced the same things&quot; or &quot;I thought I was the only one that felt like that&quot;..or something similar. These are not just words put down on paper, It is a wealth of Realities..
