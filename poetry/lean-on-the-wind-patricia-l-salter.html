  <title>Lean on the Wind - Patricia L. Salter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Patricia Salter was born into a lively and creative family. The second of five children, her father was a professor and her mother a published poet. Although she was born in Philadelphia, she has lived the greater part of her life in Madison, Wisconsin. Hers was a peripatetic family, giving her and her siblings the opportunity to live East, West, and South while growing up. &lt;b&gt;Lean on the Wind&lt;/b&gt; reflects the passions and challenges of her younger years, while also demonstrating her love of music, art, gardening, and nature. Although most of the poems were written nearly a half century ago, these words, like a just-discovered fine wine, have mellowed with the years and come to us as smooth, evocative and satisfying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Poets Apology&lt;/b&gt;
How else can I say what the sky is tonight,
Where is there a word still unsung?
Theres a ribbon of goldalas!this is trite
But still tis a ribbonfar flung,
From the reaches of heaven to the edge of the earth,
A ribbon of gold is unfurled,
Ah! I mourn that there is in my brain such a dearth
Of words to describe my loved world.
But what can I do, thats not long since been done
By poets more skillful than I
They wrote of this beauty ere I had begun,
Yet, I am here now. I must try!" />
