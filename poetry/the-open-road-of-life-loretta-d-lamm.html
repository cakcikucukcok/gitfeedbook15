  <title>The Open Road of Life - Loretta D. Lamm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Being a mother of three I certainly know the challenges that every day life can bring. But, what about the painful past? How does one cope with horrid memories of an abusive childhood? How does one overcome the guilt of years of alcohol and drug abuse? How does one grasp the very threads of life and maintain a mere existence in a world filled with much corruption?  I can tell you that the Lord Jesus Christ is the One Who lowered the pistol from my right temple and gave me hope in my meaningless life. He is the Answer to every question I have, the Mender of every problem I face, the Forgiver of every sin I commit, and the Leader of every step that I take! He has made all of the difference in my life! He IS the difference! He IS the Truth, the Way, and the Life! He IS!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Over time, on my endless journey, He has wiped away the tears and given me the courage to look back with a forgiving and shameless heart. He has given me the strength to move forward in each new day!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;In my book, &lt;I&gt;The Open Road of Life&lt;/I&gt;, there are poems, inspirations, prayers, and true stories telling what the Lord has put on my heart since I gave my life back to Him. Some tell of what Hes brought me through while others tell of lessons learned. Feel the pains of the past and the confusions of what every day life can bring. Read how the love of God has comforted and brought so much joy to my life through faith and trust in Him. Discover the beauty of lifes many wonders. Read about the changes He has made in me and know that He will do the same for you.  See how He opened my eyes and heart and gave me a deeper appreciation and respect for everyone and everything around me, but most of all a greater desire and love for Him!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;&quot;I LOVE You fervently and devotedly, O Lord, my Strength. The Lord is my Rock, my Fortress, and my Deliverer; my God, my keen and firm Strength in Whom I will trust and take refuge, my Shield, and the Horn of my salvation, my High Tower. I will call upon the Lord, Who is to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.&quot; Psalm 18:1-3 AMP&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;May the love of God be real to you today as you read what His love has done for me!  May you know that He truly loves you regardless of what youve done or where youve been. What really matters now is where youll go from here. So kick off your shoes, wiggle your toes a bit, and take a little stroll with Him down &lt;I&gt;The Open Road of Life!&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/P&gt;" />
