      <meta name="description" content="Many of us are born into families where we become increasingly more bondaged as we grow. There are those forbidden things that we are prohibited from doing. There are our natural curiosities that are stifled. There are boundaries placed on activities and spaces. Our worlds become smaller and smaller for our best interests. Our worlds become fraught by the cannots rather than the can-dos. And before we know it, the adult fears of our parents and teachers become internalized by us so that we too become self-imprisoned by all manner of fears and constraints. We become fearful of adventure, travel, books, motorcycles, one another and much more. However, there remains a vestige within each of us of desiredesire to shed the bonds and break free to flight. This struggle plays out on many levels: the spiritual, psychological, material and relational. For me, it has been through an interplay of the internal and external that I am beginning to become unleashed to become the person whom I think God intended." />
