  <title>The New and Collected Poems of Jane Gentry - Jane Gentry, Julia Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A consummate poet, Jane Gentry Vance (1941--2014) possessed an uncanny ability to spin quietly expansive and wise verses from small details, objects, and remembered moments. Her poetry is deeply rooted in place, exuding a strong connection to the life and land of her native Kentucky. Gentry was also a beloved and influential teacher. She served as a mentor to generations of young writers and worked tirelessly to promote new voices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gentry and her daughters collaborated with editor Julia Johnson to organize this definitive collection. The result is an important assembly of Gentry&#39;s most celebrated poems alongside new, previously unpublished works. Johnson uses Gentry&#39;s own methodology to organize the book, showcasing the range of the poet&#39;s work and the flexibility of her style -- sometimes ironic and humorous; sometimes poignant; but always clear, intelligent, and revelatory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This volume includes two previously published full-length collections of poetry in their entirety --  &lt;I&gt;A Garden in Kentucky&lt;/I&gt; and  &lt;I&gt;Portrait of the Artist as a White Pig. &lt;/I&gt;The final section includes Gentry&#39;s unpublished work, from verses written for loved ones to a large group of recent poems that may have been intended for future collections. Alternately startling and heart-wrenching,  &lt;I&gt;The New and Collected Poetry of Jane Gentry&lt;/I&gt; offers a valuable retrospective of the celebrated poet&#39;s work.&lt;/P&gt;" />
