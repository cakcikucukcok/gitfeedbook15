  <title>My Thoughts and Inspirations - H. A. Geiffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I currently reside in Lathrop, Ca with my wife and children. I was born in New Orleans, LA July 20, 1966 to Lena Mae Griffin and Harris Elmore. I am the seventh of eight children whom are as different as night and day. We moved to Oakland, CA when i was about 5 yrs old. Most of my life was spent in Oakland and Berkeley where I was considered exceptional and gifted. I was later introduce to Mrs. Jenkins, a high school teacher, who thought it best to challenge me by asking me to write a poem for Black History month. Later that turned into editing the school newspaper whereas I was the journalist, photographer, sportswriter, and any other position needed to produce the paper. She also put on a play, Raisin in the Sun in which I enjoyed due to the fact I was a very sheltered person and it allowed others to see another side of me. Throughout the years I have entered poetry contest and passed around my writings on the street, and now I feel the need to share my thoughts and ideas with everyone else. Hope you enjoy and appreciate what I have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;God bless and be safe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
