Malcolm published his first book of poems in 1978 and the first Kitchell Collection in 2004, to which this collection is a sequel.
Since 1975, Pams photographs of persons around the globe involved in their everyday lives have been used in textbooks and magazines and exhibited in a variety of galleries, libraries, churches, and other public places in the United States and Japan.
Her fascination with the beauty of human faces and people at work and play has led her to celebrate the ordinary since her dad first put a camera in her hands when she was ten and asked her to be the family photographer.
Carol Corea is a Madison, New Jersey, native who has spent most of her life in Morris County. She has studied many languages and has traveled abroad extensively in her youth.
Carol graduated from Hamilton College and is currently a manager in the insurance industry. She is a photography aficionado and enjoys capturing lifes moments spontaneously.
