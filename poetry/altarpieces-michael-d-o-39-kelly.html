  <title>Altarpieces - Michael D. O&#39;Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Fire?ies at dawn. . .&lt;br&gt;
Winged essences, charred bodies still on ?re.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evocative poetry-essay collection issues a call for a renewed embracement of the readers own expressive self. Weve each a persona to hear --- a voice to resonate through silences of night and the noises of everyday. Life is a mystery hard to crack. We bang it like a door and strum it like a lyre until it opens some new portal through which the voice can authentically sound-out the truths of being human. Thats the happening of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Altarpieces have always been artistic creations to conceive lifes sacred space. This book follows that tradition, if rather untraditionally.  These pieces speak to hear life on ones own terms; from ones own altar and cathedral.  This gathering created a poet-self identity --- called Apokstrophes. The essays join with the poems to conceive poetry and the spiritual quest with a renewed existential-eco-romantic perspective; sounding that quest with both feet grounded on worldly other Planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge to grasp life at the core is a wrenching-wrestling match with the Other, that ever-present dimension of poetry on lifes path. --- Joining philosophical play with the authenticity of word-pieces as true orients, OKellys book, with many poets helping along the way, has taken up that challenge with unflinching creativity.  Want a spiritual adventure? Fly! Take the ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Oh, the ride! Fins spurred in shivers of hide.&lt;br&gt;
Lifes dearness reined in the roll of the tide.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
