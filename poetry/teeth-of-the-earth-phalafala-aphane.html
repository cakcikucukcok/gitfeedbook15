  <title>Teeth of the Earth - Phalafala Aphane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Teeth of the Earth is a treasure trovea
scintillating mix of fl avours with
shattering experiences from a variety of
locations that explore universal aspects such as
love, life, birth, death, religion, disillusionment,
politics, praise invocation and criticism of
society and persons, as well as some more specifi c
issues like prejudice and inequity  penetrating
comments on social and philosophical events
ranging from the traditional rural tranquility
to urbanized life that is modernity in Africa.
The poems offer a banquet replete with irony,
piquancy, sadness and joy. They have an intensity
and a lightness of touch, the lines fl owing with
effortless and pleasing rhythm like the river silent in the night. One poem
gives much to think about in its own right, although the temptation to turn
the page to read the next one is overpowering. The imagery and feeling seem
to draw the reader into a deep sympathy and identifi cation of each poem
crackles with its own unique intelligence and revelatory experience. These are
just poems, poems of constant revelations that strengthen the bond between
us rather than alienating us. This book will be found invaluable by scholars,
pleasure and general readers. Savour it for knowledge enrichment." />
