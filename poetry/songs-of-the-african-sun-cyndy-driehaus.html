  <title>Songs of the African Sun - Cyndy Driehaus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The authors adventurous world travels led her to South Africa and Swaziland in the summer of 2013, a destination she had only dreamed of as she watched movies and read books about the African plains and sunsets. An opportunity to visit a family member working in Swaziland led her to plan the trip of a lifetime across the ocean and into a land rich with magnificent landscapes, curious and friendly natives, and an animal kingdom that left her breathless. 
Join Cyndy Driehaus as she whisks you along on her journey with thought provoking imagery and photography on five safaris and resting peacefully in the mountains of Swaziland with her family. 
As she easily selected favorite photographs out of dozens from the trip, the poems she wrote flowed easily and quickly, as the images were still fresh in her memory dazzling her mind and senses. 
Cyndy hopes you can visit this continent, rich with history and color. But if you arent able to, she knows this book will take you there." />
