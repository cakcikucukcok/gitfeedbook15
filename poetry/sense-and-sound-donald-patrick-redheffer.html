  <title>Sense and Sound - Donald Patrick Redheffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sense and Sound presents a new collection of more than five hundred poems exploring more than one hundred and fifty subjects, including aging, love, war, religion, and beauty. This inspiring collection of verse addresses the fundamental concerns of the human condition. The poetry roams freely, reaching for abstract truth one moment and touching upon human frailty the next. These verses consider many topics in the struggle to make sense of the mystery of life including issues of the head and the heart. 
Sense and Sound is organized alphabetically by topic for ease of use. Author Donald Patrick Redheffer writes with emotional depth and understanding while bringing his poetry to life.
The Poet
My songs can be deliberate
With thought well defined,
Or they can be pure surprise 
Unknown to the mind.
When the heart insinuates,
Words find their own way.
With sense and sound they surround
 Our feelings to betray.
Once this avalanche of feeling
Has tight hold of me
There is no way to look away
From what Ive come to be.
The poet hopes his precious words
Will someday live to be
A cherished memory of the race
Facing its mortality." />
