  <title>My Soul Lives On - Brendan Barry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments left in the guest book at Brendans funeral:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 6th grade when everyone would stand outside of Tinseltown, Brendan disappeared for about thirty minutes, only to come back walking a lobster on a cat leash. Only Brendan would ever think of that.Jeff F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan was a very respectful, funny, and fun-loving young man. Joey F.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ill especially miss the way you could walk into a room full of strangers and make everyone laugh, and charm your way into everyones heart. Nikki D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan was always so fun and loving. He could make us laugh no matter the situation. The night he made finger puppets in the lights from the police cars, and got arrested was just one of the many memories Brendan shared. Taylor, Heather, Maria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan was a beautiful and amazing person. Always knew how to put a smile on someones face. There wasnt a day that went by without him making someone smile, or even when they needed cheering up. He made a difference in our lives.Jamie, Ashley, Chelsea&lt;/p&gt;" />
