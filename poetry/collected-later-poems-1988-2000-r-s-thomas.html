  <title>Collected Later Poems 1988-2000 - R.S. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;R.S. Thomas (1913-2000) is one of the major poets of our time, as well as one of the finest religious poets in the English language and Wales&#39;s greatest poet. This substantial gathering of his late poems shows us the final flowering of a truly great poet still writing at the height of his powers right through his 70s and 80s. It begins with his autobiographical sequence &quot;The Echoes Return Slow&quot;, which has been unavailable for many years, and goes up to &quot;Residues&quot;, written immediately before his death at the age of 87. These powerful poems -- about time and history, the self, love, the machine, the Cross and prayer -- cover all of his major areas of questioning. This is R.S. Thomas in a winter light, his fury concentrated on the inhumanity of man and modern technology, his gaze absorbed by the God he felt in Nature, but finding nourishment in &#39;waste places&#39;. At the same time he writes with resigned feeling and immense insight, as well as grim humour and playful irony, of isolation, ageing, marriage and &#39;love&#39;s shining greenhouses&#39;. For Thomas, &#39;Poetry is that / which arrives at the intellect / by way of the heart.&#39;&lt;/div&gt;" />
