  <title>Final Call - Anson Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The messages highlighted in &lt;i&gt;Final Call&lt;/i&gt; seek to inspire others to have faith and stay positive even when things are not going well in their lives. Poet Anson Hughes has chronicled topics as diverse as life, love, and loss in this new poetry collection. From the beauty and clarity of Gods love to the challenges of his disease Scleroderma as described in the poem My Perpetual Testament, the emotions of his poetry come shining through with profound depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hughes believes that writing is a gift, and he has cherished the opportunity to share his poems with so many people over the years. He credits the Holy Spirit for inspiring his writing in &lt;i&gt;Final Call&lt;/i&gt;, a collection of poems that speaks of his values in life and his faith in Gods love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Things Are Mine&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If I ask I shall receive, if I seek, I shall find&lt;br&gt;
If I knock it shall be opened because all things are mine&lt;br&gt;
If I believe in my heart without a shadow of a doubt&lt;br&gt;
that all things are mine then it shall come about&lt;br&gt;
All things are mine because all things belong to Christ&lt;br&gt;
Christ belongs to God who holds the keys to death and life&lt;br&gt;
We are heirs to all things present and to come&lt;br&gt;
The victory is ours and our battle is already won&lt;br&gt;
If I ask I shall receive, if I seek, I shall find&lt;br&gt;
If I knock it shall be opened because all things are mine&lt;/i&gt;" />
