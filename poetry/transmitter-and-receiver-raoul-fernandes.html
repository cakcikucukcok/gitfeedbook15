  <title>Transmitter and Receiver - Raoul Fernandes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Debut talent Raoul Fernandes&amp;#8217;s first offering is &lt;I&gt;Transmitter and Receiver&lt;/I&gt;, a masterful and carefully depicted exploration of one&amp;#8217;s relationships with oneself, friends, memories, strangers and technology.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The three parts of this collection are variations building on a theme&amp;#151;at times lonely, sometimes adoring, but always honest. Wider areas of contemplation&amp;#151;the difficulty of communication, the ever-changing symbolism of language and the nature of human interaction in the age of machines&amp;#151;are explored through colloquial scenes of the everyday: someone eats a burger in a car parked by the river (&amp;#147;Grand Theft Auto: Dead Pixels&amp;#8221;), a song plays on the radio as a man contemplates suicide (&amp;#147;Car Game&amp;#8221;), and a janitor works silently once everyone else has gone (&amp;#147;After Hours at the Centre For Dialogue&amp;#8221;).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forthright and effortlessly lyrical, Fernandes builds each poem out of candor and insight, an addictive mix that reads like a favorite story and glitters with concealed meaning. Rather than drawing lines between isolation and connection, past and present, metaphor and reality, &lt;I&gt;Transmitter and Receiver&lt;/I&gt; offers loneliness and longing hand-in-hand with affection and understanding: &amp;#147;The last assembly instruction is always you reading this. A machine / that rarely functions, but could never without you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;" />
