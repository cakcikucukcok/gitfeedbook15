  <title>Season Two: Warrior As I Preach - Poetry Including Dragonism: The Unrisen - Kenneth R. Gerety</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here are a few echoes from the Shiver, with also a few orders left to complete. There are also a few ornaments now assembled, to round out this imaginative feat. This next collection comes after and during a time of life set to pass. This comes before the next step, which may require a new army to mass. I&#39;ll leave you, humble reader, to judge it, for I&#39;ve no battle to fight, though I&#39;d war. I may often seem as a preacher, but only since my wounds are still sore. I don&#39;t have the energy to battle, so I&#39;ll settle for a few simple lies. Illusions they may be, delusions of grace, but only in response to Dragon&#39;s cries. Review with me a few tidbits, some tasty conclusions of zeal. My convictions are tightening over my heart, and with gracious skin, I now feel.  (This Season can also be found in &quot;Collection 2: Rags of Gallery&quot;)" />
