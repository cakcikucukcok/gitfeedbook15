  <title>On Faith We Fly - Kenny Lord</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED BY AN OASIS. IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY HOT DESERT, AN ISOLATED AREA OF VEGITATION, SURROUNDED BY A BEAUTIFUL SPRING, PICTURES A GARDEN OF PARADISE. THIS OASIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO TRAVELLERS, SO THAT THEY CAN REPLINISH THEIR WATER SUPPLIES, AS THEY GO ABOUT THEIR JOURNIES. A SOURCE OF LIFE FOR MIGRATING BIRDS. IMAGINE, CRYSTAL CLEAR WATER, FORMED BY AN UNDERGROUND RIVER,  IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME OF THE HOTTEST PLACES ON EARTH, WITH PALM TREES IN THE COOL SHADE.
TO THIS, I BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON HAS THEIR OWN OASIS WITHIN THEMSELFS. SOMETIMES, WE JUST HAVE TO FIND IT.  A PLACE THAT IS SO WAY OUT THERE, THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DONT WANT TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY, BCEAUSE IT IS EITHER TOO HARD TO GET TO, OR THEY DONT BELIEVE ITS WORTH THE EFFORT.
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN THAT PLACE OF BEAUTY. WHERE THE PUREST WATERS ARE SURROUNDED BY SHADES OF GREEN AND WHERE THIS PLACE IS AS IMPORTANT TO EVERYONE ELSE, AS IT IS TO ME. WHERE THE UNDERGROUND RIVERS WITHIN US, RISE UP TO MEET THE TASKS AT HAND.
I HAVE SEEN THE WELL PAVED PATHS THAT HAVE LED TO PROMISED PALACES, BUT I WOULD RATHER TAKE THE WINDY DUNES OF THE SAND, TO MY AWAITING OASIS.
