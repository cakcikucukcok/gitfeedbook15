  <title>Rock Bottom - Sabrina Allen, Dayna Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is designed for those that desire a closer relationship and fellowship with the Father. As the reader reads this poetry, we feel once they grasp the idea to look at our Father and not the situation(s) they may face, they will find that God is a way maker and in his presence there is peace. So many times in life, we awake in a strange land; meaning, this is a new place in our lives and/or families, we are not sure how we got here or how to get back to that first love, which is God. We can have all of those things that God has designed; all we have to do is to ask. We communicate with our Father when we read, pray, fast, talk, and sing to him. Giving a total submission to God and allowing him to shine through our being, readers will find that when God has our undivided attention, how he turns a bad situation to a glorified project for his kingdom. When we dont communicate with God, we experience separation, and this makes us feel that God is far away from us and perhaps we may even feel that he has given up on us. This is the flesh and carnal nature talking to us, based on our emotions. God is with us even when we hit the bottom." />
