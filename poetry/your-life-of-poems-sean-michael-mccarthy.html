  <title>Your Life of Poems - Sean Michael McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My first book was mainly based around myself and my hardships and emotions and experiences and thoughts and the collection spans some 10 years.
This follow up book however, is written more for others and is a collection put together in 2016/17.
Inspiration was taken from world events, past and present, and from the loss of loved ones and friends suffering. I write to express the feelings others have trouble finding words for.
I hope you enjoy and that maybe the words help. Theres something for everyone and most subjects are covered if you take both collections.
I think I have exhausted my thoughts for now so plan to take a break and try my hand at writing a novel so keep your eye out." />
