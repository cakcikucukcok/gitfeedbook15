  <title>You Don’T Know Me - Donna L Prince-Baylis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;If a picture can say a thousand words, it can also leave a thousand unsaid. How well do you really know the person sitting beside you, the work colleague across the desk from you? You see their rise up the corporate ladder, their smiling children, their immaculate house, but do you really see them?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Chances are, what you see is not what you get. Take me for example. I have a wonderful job, a house, a car, two amazing children, and friends and family who I know love me and are there for me no matter what. On the outside, I&#39;m one of the luckiest people around. But my journey here would probably shock some people, even my friends. Some would be sad, and others would feel sorry for me.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Yes, it&#39;s been hard; it&#39;s been painful, and sometimes I&#39;ve wanted to crawl under a rock and never come out, but my journey is what&#39;s made me the person I am today. Heartache, pain, sorrow, joy, and laughter are all parts of life. We all live it; we all feel it, and hopefully we all grow and learn from it. I&#39;m sharing my journey so others might see that, no matter how hard things may seem, life goes on. You do get through it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Keep searching for the way to happiness because life is worth it. I knowIm living it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
