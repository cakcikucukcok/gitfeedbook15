  <title>Helen of Troy and Other Poems - Sara Teasdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sappho&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The twilight&amp;#39;s inner flame grows blue and deep,&lt;br /&gt;
And in my Lesbos, over leagues of sea,&lt;br /&gt;
The temples glimmer moonwise in the trees.&lt;br /&gt;
Twilight has veiled the little flower face&lt;br /&gt;
Here on my heart, but still the night is kind&lt;br /&gt;
And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast.&lt;br /&gt;
Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk&lt;br /&gt;
Along the surges creeping up the shore&lt;br /&gt;
When tides came in to ease the hungry beach,&lt;br /&gt;
And running, running, till the night was black,&lt;br /&gt;
Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand&lt;br /&gt;
And quiver with the winds from off the sea?&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, quietly the shingle waits the tides&lt;br /&gt;
Whose waves are stinging kisses, but to me&lt;br /&gt;
Love brought no peace, nor darkness any rest.&lt;br /&gt;
I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands&lt;br /&gt;
And cried to Love, from whom the sea is sweet,&lt;br /&gt;
From whom the sea is bitterer than death.&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, Aphrodite, if I sing no more&lt;br /&gt;
To thee, God&amp;#39;s daughter, powerful as God,&lt;br /&gt;
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet&lt;br /&gt;
To hold the added sweetness of a song.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a quiet at the heart of love,&lt;br /&gt;
And I have pierced the pain and come to peace.&lt;br /&gt;
I hold my peace, my Cleis, on my heart;&lt;br /&gt;
And softer than a little wild bird&amp;#39;s wing&lt;br /&gt;
Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, never any more when spring like fire&lt;br /&gt;
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves,&lt;br /&gt;
Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude&lt;br /&gt;
Beyond the lure of light Alcaeus&amp;#39; lyre,&lt;br /&gt;
Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna&amp;#39;s voice.&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, never with a throat that aches with song,&lt;br /&gt;
Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring,&lt;br /&gt;
Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love&lt;br /&gt;
The quiver and the crying of my heart.&lt;br /&gt;
Still I remember how I strove to flee&lt;br /&gt;
The love-note of the birds, and bowed my head&lt;br /&gt;
To hurry faster, but upon the ground&lt;br /&gt;
I saw two winged shadows side by side,&lt;br /&gt;
And all the world&amp;#39;s spring passion stifled me.&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, Love, there is no fleeing from thy might,&lt;br /&gt;
No lonely place where thou hast never trod,&lt;br /&gt;
No desert thou hast left uncarpeted&lt;br /&gt;
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet.&lt;br /&gt;
In many guises didst thou come to me;&lt;br /&gt;
I saw thee by the maidens while they danced,&lt;br /&gt;
Phaon allured me with a look of thine,&lt;br /&gt;
In Anactoria I knew thy grace,&lt;br /&gt;
I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes;&lt;br /&gt;
But never wholly, soul and body mine,&lt;br /&gt;
Didst thou bid any love me as I loved.&lt;br /&gt;
Now I have found the peace that fled from me;&lt;br /&gt;
Close, close, against my heart I hold my world.&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, Love that made my life a lyric cry,&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, Love that tuned my lips to lyres of thine,&lt;br /&gt;
I taught the world thy music, now alone&lt;br /&gt;
I sing for one who falls asleep to hear." />
