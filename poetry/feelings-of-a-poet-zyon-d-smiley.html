  <title>Feelings of a Poet - Zyon D. Smiley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An African proverb states, When a man knows his proverbs, he can reconcile his differences. A similar sentiment can be said about poetry; if a man knows his poetry, he can overcome heavy burdens and add flavor to life experiences. The poems in this book were born out of my experiences with romance, love, joy, happiness, pain, fear, sadness and anxiety  emotions all people experiences. The poetry in this book is far more than just words. These words are a life force captured from moments in time, much like images caught on a video tape or music recorded on a cd. This book looks at intimate daily experiences and the natural world around us. Reflect, meditate, and ponder to look for hidden truth and meaning in each poem. Step into the world of in depth feelings, along with the ecstasy of expression." />
