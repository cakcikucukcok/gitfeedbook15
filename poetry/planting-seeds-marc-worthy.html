  <title>Planting Seeds - Marc Worthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Planting Seeds is a collection of spoken words that have been brought to me over the years. These words are from my heart, mind, and soul brought upon to reflect change. All of my Spoken words are based on my personal experiences. Experiences that have touched my life in one way or another.
This collection attempts to breakdown the five sides that GOD has revealed to me. These five sides will help the world understand change through my thoughts and philosophies. My philosophy on life is to empower the minds in our black communities.
The first of the five sides that GOD has given me is the bless side. The blessed side shows that nothing is possible without Christ. For he has given me the gift to inspire others. The second side is the love and healing side. Through this side, GOD has shown me how to love. Love is the first essential key to winning others over. A testimony brings about the healing. The third side is the political side. The political side examines the eyes of the oppressed showing them alternatives to their setbacks. The fourth side is the life side.
Life is the side I have experienced my trials and tribulations. This is the side that led me to the righteousness of GOD. The final side of me is the personal side. This side allows the reader to come in contact with the author. 
In conclusion, this collection of spoken-words would help rehabilitate the roles of the black males and the black females. Its positive RAP.
This book is essential to the development of our black communities. The media has displayed a sense of falsehood through the disrespect of the Black woman as well as the negative representation of violence within the Black male, through TV as well as Radio. Hopefully this book of spoken-words will inspire a positive change through the wisdom that GOD has bestowed upon me. Now that the instructions has been given, I feel that its my 
duty to educate all of my blacks peers at large.
In comparison to other books of poetry, this book of spoken-words relate to issues of life. That causes the mind to ponder, In essence, producing a change. This collection takes every aspect of life by sides and shows the reader how to change. The result of change is in understanding the sides of who you are. Every side must be understood. 
- It speaks to the youth.
- It speaks to the community.
- It speaks to modern day dilemmas.
- It offers youth and community an answer to these dilemmas and invites them to talk, think and work  together to bring about a positive change.
- It speaks to Spirituality.
-A strong relationship with GOD as an anchor.
- Its proactive and anti violent.
-A positive out-look on life." />
