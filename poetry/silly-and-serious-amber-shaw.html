  <title>Silly and Serious - Amber Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book: Silly and serious is the first of 3 that I have in mind to start out with. This book contains a compilation of the poetry that I have written. It is only a small amount considering what is yet to be published, but it is a start.  
I titled my book Silly and Serious, because that is what it is. I have some silly, very imaginative and plain out right goofy- nonsensical poetry. Then I also have some deep, thoughtful, and symbolic poetry.  I want to bring them together, so a reader can experience a mixture of emotions, instead of dwelling on a single emotion. The poetry is not limited to my newest material, this book, as well as any other I write will have poetry from several years ago, to some very recent material Ive decided to include. 
I have included the dates when I wrote my poetry as a chronological tool, because my writing style has transformed a bit and broadened over the years. It is a work of art, creativity, passion and love. It contains joy, sorrow, love, anguish, hope, and a vague sense of longing for something more. 
My ability to rhyme, keep rhythm, and produce a piece of literature are all things I really like, and that will be evident in this book.  I also use my creative license when forming a stanza. I take into consideration what the poem will look like on the page, and how it will relay the message. Do not look for your standard format of poetry and stanza formation. In a way each poem will bear uniqueness to a certain extent, and begs for your ability to interpret arrangement in order to find the full meaning, like in my poem line for line. If you skim this poem, you will not understand it. You must do as the title says, and read each line as if it was its own independent sentence. Each stanza in this particular poem has a completed theme that comes together with all stanzas for the overall statement of the poem. Some of my poems tell fictional stories, my others have strait forward messages about life, but they are written in similes and metaphors, so they are not literally straightforward, but the underlying message is there. Please do not be intimidated, it is not hard to understand my poetry. If you are looking for poetry that is different from most out there, you have found it. I live inspired, I live for God. Thank you for your interest! Sincerely, Amber Shaw" />
