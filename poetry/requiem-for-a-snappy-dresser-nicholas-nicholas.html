  <title>Requiem for a Snappy Dresser - Nicholas Nicholas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his new collection of poetry, &lt;em&gt;Requiem for a Snappy Dresser: Poems of Expiation and Conceit&lt;/em&gt;, author &lt;strong&gt;Nicholas Nicholas&lt;/strong&gt; shares his attempt to reconcile his own life in terms of family, sex, love, loneliness, illness, death, and aging. This compilation of his work offers autobiographical, adult-themed poems, many of them explicit and on the subject of being gay. He presented some of these verses during his ongoing psychotherapy sessions in a Los Angeles, California Veterans Administration medical center, writing them as he fought paranoia, fear, disease, depression, and enormous self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas considers these and other issues with often brutal candor, shocking irreverence, sensitivity, defiance, and surprising humor. He writes with honesty about the danger, loneliness, and pain of self-isolation. With this collection of poems, he hopes to provide others with insight, understanding, and maybe some compassion for all peoplemale or female, gay or straightas they approach and experience their own inevitable final years of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One More Poem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
