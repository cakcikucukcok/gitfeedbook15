  <title>The Closet Poets’ Interlude - Paola Nicole, Alisha May</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Closet Poets Interlude brings you an authentically transparent, heartbreaking, and empowering look at what it is like to be young and in love while still trying to find an individual identity in the process.
Authors PN and AM take you along their own journeys of self-discovery, self-worth, and the illusion of love they had to endure to get there. The words on these pages describe the pain and honesty of being wrapped in love in a way that makes you feel like they know exactly what you are going through.
Included as well are poems that are inspiring and liberating versions of themselves, overcoming their trials, and finally accepting that they deserve to be loved the right way. This is a modern-day epiphany of the heart and soul." />
