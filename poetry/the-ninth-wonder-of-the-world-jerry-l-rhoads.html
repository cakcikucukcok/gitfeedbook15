  <title>The Ninth Wonder of the World - Jerry L. Rhoads</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Eighth Wonder is the first poem and the theme for my first poetry book. I reveal in that poem what the eighth wonder is and its value to each person on earth. I dont want it revealed until they read that first poem and hopefully will use that eighth wonder to find the other wonders of the world, then read the rest of The Ninth Wonder of the World exercising their eighth wonder.
Poetry is so personal it is hard to convince readers to take the time to feel the words not just read them. The Eighth Wonder of the World presents something we all possess and dont realize its value. So for this second book to resonate with the buyer/reader, a love of poetry will initially be the reason it sells. After that, it will be the value to each reader as they capitalize on the eighth wonder we all possess." />
