  <title>Black Shadows and Through the White Looking Glass - William E. Waters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Black Shadows and Through the White Looking Glass: Remembrance of Things Past and Present is about the captivity, exploitation and suffering of Black people in America, and their triumphs.  
The author, a history buff, took the challenge to look at the history of Black people in America, who are normally given one month, the shortest month of the year, February, to highlight Black History in America, and wrote this epic.  For those who would separate Black History in America from American history, know this: American history and Black History in America are one and the same; one does not exist without the other, even though the latter has oftentimes been relegated to the shadows of American history.
Black Shadows and Through the White Looking Glass is a co-winner of the Edwin Mellen Poetry Prize for an epic poem (1998) and was published in 2000 by the Edwin Mellen Poetry Press." />
