  <title>Quicksilver of the Heart - Brenda Peddigrew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Invite these poems to companion your heart and let them stretch your soul.
Brendas spare, simple words say big things. In this very intimate collection we
are offered messages of lifes mysteries in a language as clear as any fine spiritual
direction. Throbbing through the poems is her Celtic sensibility, offered in the
calm dialect of a sagacious heart bred to thrive in Newfoundland weather. Taken
as talismans of transformation, these poems beg rereading, like stories retold over
strong tea to take off the chill and to strengthen the heart. We are whispered secret
courage to engage life, open-eyed and ready. The stanzas give voice to the quiet
satisfactions of honest, open-hearted awareness and offer a travelers guide into a
soulscape both delicate and wild. From a knowing of winters graced grit to the full
out exhilaration of the greening again spring, Brenda opens to us the experience of
a woman stepping into elder-hood well versed in living close to the heart of things.
Look, she says to us, despite any initial evidence to the contrary, small moments are
thresholds into soul size transformations and no less than lifes best gift. (Gabriele
Uhlein OSF, author and artist, Meditations with Hildegard of Bingen)" />
