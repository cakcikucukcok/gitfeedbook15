      <meta name="description" content="Words are prayerfully 
complaining 
about whose playful writing? 
Beautiful images are seen 
wrapped in paper clothing. 
This is the opening couplet of Ghalibs Divan and it captures his view of the badly broken world in which he lived and Gods indifference to human condition. The poet faces God and poses a question: Why did you create this universe? What was the purpose? If this is your creation, why do we have so much misery and suffering? Was this creation an act of playfulness or did it have a nobler purpose? People praying and pleading in front of the Creator with paper clothing covering their naked bodies is symbolic of their complete helplessness. In many ways, this sets the stage for Ghalibs struggle to make sense of reality and find a new rationale for our relationship with God." />
