      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Interest in coin collecting and paper money is at an all-time high, thanks in part to the new designs of modern U.S. coins and currency, the increasing market value of precious metals, and the great investment coin collecting has been in recent years. Recent reports estimate that there are over 1 million serious coin collectors in the U.S. And the U.S. Mint estimates that nearly 150 million people have collected the 50 State Quarters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bestselling &lt;i&gt;Warman&#39;s Coins &amp;amp; Paper Money&lt;/i&gt;, now in its 5th edition, is the most comprehensive, colorful, informative, and thorough identification and price guide of its kind. It covers everything from the evolution of U.S. coins and currency to the latest in minted coinage. Big, bold and informative, this invaluable tool is a must-have for collectors of all levels, whether they are children or adults, novice or experienced veterans. But this book doesn&#39;t stop at U.S. coins and currency. It also features a panoramic and full-color view of coins and currency from Canada, Mexico, and Europe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A veteran numismatist by trade and passion, &lt;b&gt;Arlyn G.
