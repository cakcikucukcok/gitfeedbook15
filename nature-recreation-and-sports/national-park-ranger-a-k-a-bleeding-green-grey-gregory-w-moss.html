  <title>National Park Ranger, A.K.A., &quot;Bleeding Green &amp; Grey&quot; - Gregory W. Moss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="National Park Ranger, a.k.a., Bleeding Green &amp; Grey tells the stories that cover well beyond just the numerous and sometimes daily heroic deeds that other present park ranger books more than adequately validate.  However, these new true-life tales not only embrace such topics as the customary high adventure cases, the sometimes humorous park visitors, and the dealing with the unfortunate death &amp; mayhem; but now include various accounts of handling previously considered taboo matters such as limited budgets, hiring difficulties, increasing outside agency assists, and unfortunately, politics and bureaucracy.  
Also, something rather different in dealing with the typical stoical federal government, author Greg Moss actually enjoys to not only show the amusement side of dealing with the unusual park visitor actions, but also pokes fun of himself or other park staff.  All those emergency life-or-death call-out operations and boring administrative meetings dont go off quite as smoothly as most other books on park rangers currently portray, or even totally ignore.  This author uses a lot of dry humor, satire, and sarcasm in his book which makes you laugh out loud, scratch your head, and say, Really?  Is that true?" />
