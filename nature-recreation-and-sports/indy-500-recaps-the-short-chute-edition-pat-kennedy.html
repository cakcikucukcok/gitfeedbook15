  <title>Indy 500 Recaps—The Short Chute Edition - Pat Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book started as a self-serving exercise to personally organize the major details and interesting facts of each Indianapolis 500 over the hundred-plus-year history of the greatest race in the world. For many of us passionate racing fans who have attended a multitude of 500s, there is a tendency for the details of the races to (somewhat) blend together. I hope this book will help to provide clarity in this regard, as well as educate. 
During high school, many of us chose to use CliffsNotes to assist in the education process. This book is somewhat patterned after that concept. It falls somewhere between Donald Davidson and Rick Schafferthe best and by far the most detailed book on the history of the Indianapolis 500and a multitude of pictorial books with limited information. I hope it will prove to be an easy read with entertaining and educational information." />
