  <title>God’S Perfect, Persistent Love for All People - Dr. Victoria Ireoluwa Amedu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God loves us with a perfect, unconditional love. It is an agape lovea love that is sacrificial, nonjudgmental, uncondemning, and unwavering. But God not only wants us to embrace this love he has for us, he also wants us to love both him and other people with the same kind of perfect love.
In Gods Perfect, Persistent Love for All People, author Dr. Victoria Ireoluwa Amedu invites all of Gods children to take on Gods perfect, persistent love and to rely on it to help overcome all kinds of calamity, destitution, persecution, and hungerboth in our own lives and in the lives of others. Through both struggle and triumph, our loving God is always there to see us through lifes challenges and bless us with success. But he also gives us a command:
This is My commandment: that you love one another [just] as I have loved you. No one has greater love [no one has shown stronger affection] than to lay down (give up) his own life for his friends. (John 15:1213 AMP)
Gods Perfect, Persistent Love for All People reminds us of Christs example and of his commandment, and just as God loved us so much that he gave his only begotten Son so that we all may be saved and have eternal life with him in heaven, we too must give of ourselves to share this love with our earthly brothers, sisters and all humanities." />
