  <title>Perplexing Puzzles (Circle a Word) with Intriguing Topics - Nicole Rachelle Sprankles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Contains inspiring, in depth word searches. Topics range from sports such as football, baseball, basketball, car racing, snow skiing, and golf to games such as board games, card games, and arcade games. There are a handful of Spanish puzzles. Also included, are activities like sewing, food, leaf collection, and horse terminology. Occupations and technical topics are covered along with a wide range of music related topics.&lt;p&gt; 
Originally these word searches were created to be uplifting and provide a positive activity for people in correctional facilities. A portion, of the proceeds from this word search book, will be used to purchase word search books for correctional facilities. These books will be distributed to correctional facilities by an outreach ministry called Christmas Behind Bars. Further information about this organization is available at&lt;p&gt;
