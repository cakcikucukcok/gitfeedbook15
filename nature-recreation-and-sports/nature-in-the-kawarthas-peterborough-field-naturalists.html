  <title>Nature in the Kawarthas - Peterborough Field Naturalists</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here you will find a wealth of information on the fauna, flora, and natural wonders of the Kawarthas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kawarthas sit astride the Canadian Shield and fertile lands to the south. This is cottage country  a place where people are closer to nature and where children and adults remark on the sightings of animals, birds, and butterflies from windows and lakeside chairs and ask questions about what they see. This book is a valuable asset and will answer many of these questions. It offers an alternative to a shelf of field guides and deals with what can be expected in a relatively small but uniquely rich environment close to home. &lt;i&gt;Nature in the Kawarthas &lt;/i&gt;presents a wealth of information about the birds, mammals, insects, flowers, reptiles, and amphibians that inhabit this special area. It discusses rare habitats and the behaviours of animals ranging from frogs to birds of prey. A Places to Go section recommends the best areas to visit to explore the natural wonders of this amazing region and its treasure of wild biodiversity. It is a true layman’s guide to nature in the Kawarthas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peterborough Field Naturalists (PFN) is a registered charity and active club in Peterborough, Ontario, that dates back to 1940. The authors include knowledgeable naturalists, teachers, and university and ministry professionals in a wide variety of wildlife fields. Their goal is to know, appreciate, and conserve nature in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
