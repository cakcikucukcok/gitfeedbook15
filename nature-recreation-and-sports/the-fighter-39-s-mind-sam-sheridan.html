  <title>The Fighter&#39;s Mind - Sam Sheridan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In his acclaimed national best seller, &lt;I&gt;A Fighter&amp;#8217;s Heart&lt;/I&gt;, Sam Sheridan took readers with him as he stepped through the ropes into the dangerous world of professional fighting. From a muay Thai bout in Bangkok to Rio, where he trained with jiu-jitsu royalty, to Iowa, where he matched up against the toughest in MMA, Sheridan threw himself into a quest to understand how and why we fight. In &lt;I&gt;The Fighter&amp;#8217;s Mind&lt;/I&gt;, Sheridan does for the brain what his first book did for the body. To uncover the secrets of mental strength and success, Sheridan interviewed dozens of the world&amp;#8217;s most fascinating and dangerous men, including celebrated trainers Freddie Roach and Greg Jackson; champion fighters Randy Couture, Frank Shamrock, and Marcelo Garcia; ultrarunner David Horton; legendary wrestler Dan Gable, and many more. What are their secrets? How do they stay committed through years of training, craft a game plan, and adjust to the realities of the ring? How do they project strength when weak, and remain mentally tough despite incredible physical pain? A fascinating book, bursting at the seams with incredible stories and insight, &lt;I&gt;The Fighter&amp;#8217;s Mind&lt;/I&gt; answers these questions and many more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
