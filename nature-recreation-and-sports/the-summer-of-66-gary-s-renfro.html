  <title>The Summer of ’66 - Gary S. Renfro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you ever wanted to win against the fiercest competition, if you ever wanted to have the best friends there could be, if you ever wanted to be the best coach or teacher, then you should read this book. It makes no difference if you are 8 or 68, people want that moment in time where everything went right, the stars were aligned and only you could see and feel it happening. This story is about that happening to a 15 year boy who dreamed every day about being the best baseball player that ever lived. He, with the help of friends, three especially, had that dream come true. He accomplished more in one year than most people do in a lifetime and baseball was a large part. His accomplishments were well beyond his 15 year old beliefs, and they established the ground work for an incredible future. How can a kid have so much fun while developing lifelong relationships, developing the ground work for being a successful dad, a good coach, a successful business person and an all around happiness in life.
So if you like hook slides, homeruns, stories about being winners, a life time of positive attitudes, well buckle up and start reading. This book is about smiling, loving and as I have already said, being a winner. I have always said that if, I learn one thing every day and make someone smile, then that day was a success. Every person who reads this book will smile and hopefully learn a small thing or two. Sit back and enjoy and thanks for allowing me to share a little of my dreams with you. Play Ball!." />
