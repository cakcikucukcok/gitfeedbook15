  <title>The Reese Boys - Tommy Shadwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Reese Boys is the story of a man, his sons, and a dream that took 25 years to bring to fruition. The story tells of joy, pain, grief, death, success, leading to fame and fortune, along with paramilitary action and millions of dollars changing hands along the way. All in the name of football.  Told by a man named Walter Reese that had one son named Ray, Walter watched the entire story transpire from the very beginning. Not ever mentioning himself, Walter tells a story that will re-instill your feelings for family, friendships and dreams. You will take a roller coaster ride of surprises and unexpected, unbelievable occurances, one after another. Ray and Robin Reese have identical twin boys on the same day at the same hospital in 1976 that Tom and Toni Tyler have twin girls. Doctor Dave Dixon introduced Ray and Tom at the baby viewing window and a family friendship started that grew stronger and stronger every year. They added to their clans year after year, seemingly planned the entire way. ;The families found happiness, joy and fun along the way, but must endure terrible pain, grief, and suffering along with it. In the end, they are closer than ever. And America loves them." />
