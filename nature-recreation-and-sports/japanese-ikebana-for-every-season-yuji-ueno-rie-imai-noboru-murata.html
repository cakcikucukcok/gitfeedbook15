  <title>Japanese Ikebana for Every Season - Yuji Ueno, Rie Imai, Noboru Murata</title>

Whether for Mother&#39;s Day, Valentine&#39;s Day, or a special birthday or anniversary&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;Japanese Ikebana for Every Season&lt;/I&gt; simplifies and demystifies this ancient art by presenting 53 elegantly simple arrangements that anyone can create at anytime at home.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The key to good Ikebana arrangements is to understand a few very simple principles&amp;#151;like the idea of &lt;I&gt;mitate&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#151;seeing old things with new eyes, as well as learning a few very easy techniques of flower stabilization and how to support plants and flowers inside a vase or container. Using simple, common flowers and plants from your garden, from a nearby field or forest, or from your local florist&amp;#151;you can easily create these lovely Ikebana in just a few minutes if you know how.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Authors Rie Imai and Yuji Ueno explain how to select the flowers and the containers by simply using things that are already around you&amp;#151;and then they show you how to turn them into something special. The basic instructions in the book cover a wide range of styles that encourage readers to use their own creativity rather than copying traditional and highly technical Ikebana design concepts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No matter what time of year it is and regardless of your taste or budget&amp;#151;the arrangements in this book will lend a touch of Japanese elegance to your home!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
