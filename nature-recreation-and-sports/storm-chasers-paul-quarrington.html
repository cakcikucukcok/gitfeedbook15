  <title>Storm Chasers - Paul Quarrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Few people seek out the tiny Caribbean island of Dampier Cay--visitors usually wash up there by accident. But this weekend, three people are flying to the island, not for a tan or fun in the sun, but because they have reason to believe that they might encounter something there that most people take great measures to avoid--a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lottery windfall and a few hours of selfishness have robbed Caldwell of all that was precious to him, while Beverly, haunted by tragedy and screwed by fate since birth, has given up on life. Also on the flight is Jimmy Newton, a professional storm chaser and videographer who will do anything for the perfect shot. Waiting for them at Dampier is the manager of the Water&#39;s Edge Hotel, Maywell Hope, a descendant of the pirates who sailed the Caribbean hundreds of hears ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their stories unfold, the tragic underpinnings of Beverly and Caldwell&#39;s lives are revealed, a storyline that builds just as the hurricane looms ever-closer on the horizon. Cinematic and harrowing, Paul Quarrington&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Storm Chasers&lt;/i&gt; is a tale of love and loss--and finding redemption in the eye of a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;" />
