  <title>Adventures with Ethan - Carolyn R. Cochren, Ethan Cochren, Brian Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of Freddy the Frog comes alive through the eyes and voice of a six-year-old boy by the name of Ethan.  Ethan explores the world of nature and encounters a variety of events that could only happen to a six-year-old boy who has quite an adventurous spirit.  Many times these events transpire with his 3 cousins and his sister who are approximately the same age.  He talks about frogs with toe-pads that land on his Nanas windows and how they stick to them.  His explanation of catching a frog, naming the frog Freddy, and how the frog landed on a tree and making a noise that sounded like SPLAT makes us wonder what he did to the frog.  He tells the story of a Wart Lady.
Living next door to his Nana gives him the opportunity to walk through the woods to her house.  It is in these woods that Ethan finds many critters and adventure stories.  His stories are imaginative and funny.  He wonders if the events really happen or if he just has dreams and remembers them to tell his Nana.  Ethan questions events such as his encounter with Freddy and the army of frogs he sees with him.  Regardless of how the story of Freddy the Frog came about, children should find this story humorous." />
