  <title>Soaring Like an Eagle   the Courtney Moses Story - Roger Lee Waters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Courtney Moses was always about basketball, from an early age playing AAU ball, up and through grade school. In the 7th grade, the high school coaches saw a girl with skills and moves that far out did other girls her own age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would possess a little girl from Sweetser, Indiana to dream about one day being Indiana Miss. Basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be that she was destined to become the greatest player in all of Oak Hill basketball history? Or was all this just chance? Being at the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtney will tell you she knew from an early age she was going to be someone special with the basketball. But as fate would have it, God had given her a gift to play, and become one of the best, on and off the court. Now the only question was, will she do what it takes to become the best, or will she just do what is needed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her story is an inspiration to all, but her story is to all those young girls who were told they can&#39;t, because they are too small, or too short, or because they are a girl. Her answer is a simple one, yes you can.&lt;/p&gt;" />
