  <title>Chasing Zero - Brandt Galloway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear someone mention the year 1996, I immediately think of that magical baseball season in which a special group of young men won forty-three consecutive baseball games. But it was so much more than just those forty-three games. It was the culmination of years of hard work and dedication to both the game they loved and the teammates they competed with. I feel truly blessed to have been a part of their journey. &lt;br /&gt;
Tim Dowdy,&lt;br /&gt;
Former New Hope Baseball Coach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spring of 96 was a magical time that I will never forget. It was a three-month period in which the stars aligned and took us on an unforgettable ride. &lt;br /&gt;
Carey Edwards,&lt;br /&gt;
Former New Hope Baseball player &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to my knees near the third base line as the ball began to get closer and closer to the ground. As a sixteen-year-old, all I could think about was how I had just let my team down. My name was going to be in the record books, the only pitcher with an L next to his name. Suddenly, my feet went numb as I stood up in disbelief. I saw what had just happened but didnt believe it. I still have never seen another catch like that! &lt;br /&gt;
