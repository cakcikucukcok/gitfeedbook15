  <title>Dog Breeding Secrets - Marcus E. Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What are the secrets to dog breeding? Its a fascinating question. It&#39;s probably the reason why you need this book. It&#39;s important to know these secrets if you are to pursue dog breeding, and the secrets are what anyone in life must seek out in any endeavor to become great at what they decide to do. This book will have many secrets, facts, and very helpful tips on dog breeding: how it is done, why it is done, when it is done, and if it should it be done. 
These secrets were learned over close to a twenty-year span of dog-breeding experience, observation of multiple successful breeders, mentorship, apprenticeship, and reading numerous books. My goal is to give you a great tool to help you understand dog breeding, what goes behind the mind of dog breeding, why it&#39;s been done for thousands of years, and if you should do it yourself. It was also designed to be a helpful guide for you to use as a positive tool for whatever else you do in life. This book contains useful information, multiple pictures, and historical quotes for you to enjoy while you&#39;re reading, as well as a reference guide. 
I truly hope you enjoy this book for now and for many years to come." />
