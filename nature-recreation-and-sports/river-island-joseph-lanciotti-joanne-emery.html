  <title>River Island - Joseph Lanciotti, Joanne Emery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;River Island&lt;/I&gt; is the history of a small, humble island called Barley Point, located on the Navesink River, in the affluent shore town of Rumson, N.J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with the first humans here, the Lenni Lenappi, who came to hunt and fish in this beautiful place during the summers before the Europeans discovered and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main story is about the summer people of the Island who rented summer shacks there before they joined together to buy it.  In particular, the author who is one of the 57 owners, describes his observations and the philosophy of life that he developed while spending his summers there for over twenty five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From its start as a collection of summer shacks built by unique people seeking a place in the summer sun, this little Island has constantly sought the acceptance of its parent, the wealthy town of Rumson.  Its early years were obscure, and mostly unnoticed, but then it sought to join the mainstream.  It applied for building permits to improve its humble condition, but found itself impeded in its efforts.  Its real estate is still very modest despite small improvements, but the Islands natural beauty on the Navesink River is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a lover of nature, you should buy this book to read it during those times of your life when you take the world too seriously.  The descriptions of the Island and the people since the Depression to the present, and the joys they received from a simple life with nature will convince you that really the best things in life are free.  Whenever you read it, it will be summer again at River Island.&lt;/p&gt;" />
