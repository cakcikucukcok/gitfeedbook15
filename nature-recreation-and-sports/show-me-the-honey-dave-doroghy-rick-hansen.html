  <title>Show Me the Honey - Dave Doroghy, Rick Hansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A lighthearted, self-deprecating account of one fledgling beekeeper&#39;s misadventures. With wit and warning in equal measure, this informative, refreshingly honest narrative will resonate with any new beekeeper.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dave Doroghy&#39;s sister gave him 15,000 honey bees as a Christmas gift, his practical knowledge of beekeeping would have fit on the proverbial backend of an Apis mellifera. He spent the next two years learning everything he needed to know to keep that beehive alive and well--he attended a beekeeping conference, joined a bee club, and even went to bee school. But bad things still happened--he sustained multiple stings, wasps attacked his hive, he fought an ongoing battle with killer varroa mites, and even lost his queen--twice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Show Me the Honey&lt;/i&gt; Doroghy recounts his often tension-filled misadventures in beekeeping with self-deprecating humour and lightheartedness. Whether it&#39;s the impending chaos of transferring tens of thousands of insects to an outyard, the horror of discovering bees on the &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; of his beekeeping suit, or just wondering if he will end up with even an ounce of honey for all his efforts, Doroghy shares the joy, the surprises, and the less-acknowledged financial sting of keeping bees. Above all, he relishes in the details of keeping a hive and getting to know the fascinating little creatures that inhabit those mysterious wooden boxes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
