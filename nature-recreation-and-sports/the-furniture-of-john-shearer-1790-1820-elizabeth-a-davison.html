  <title>The Furniture of John Shearer, 1790-1820 - Elizabeth A. Davison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a full-color catalogue raisonne interprets the distinctive furniture made by John Shearer, one of the most accomplished and intriguing furniture makers during the post-Revolutionary period. Shearer emigrated from Scotland in the late 18th century and retained loyalist sympathies throughout his life, evidenced by the imagery and inscriptions sympathetic to various British causes_such as the suppression of the Irish rebellion in 1798 and the British victory in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805_that he worked into his furniture. Davison provides insight into the furniture&#39;s appeal to Anglo-American patrons, not secret loyalists, but men still culturally tied to Great Britain. Shearer&#39;s pieces are scattered among various collections, and many of them have been identified only in the last 25 years. This catalog is the only work in which all of Shearer&#39;s known pieces of furniture are presented in a single volume." />
