  <title>Wood Turning - The Lathe and Its Accessories, Tools, Turning Between Centres Face-Plate Work, Boring, Polishing - E. A. Dinmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The object of this book is to supply this experience and to show the methods which have proved themselves reliable by the hard test of having been tried out time and again. It is thus primarily a book for the man who is taking up wood turning for the first time, though workers with some experience in the craft should also find in it much that is helpful. In the work described the reader is taken progressively from simple operations to more difficult turning, and in none of the examples is there a tool operation that has not been previously described in the opening chapters. Generally no dimensions are indicated in these examples because these are details that the reader is better able to decide for himself, partly because of the present-day shortage of timber, and also because it is important that the worker should be encouraged to arrive at pleasing forms by his own volition." />
