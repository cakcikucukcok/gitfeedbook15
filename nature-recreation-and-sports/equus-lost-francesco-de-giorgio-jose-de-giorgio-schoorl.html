  <title>Equus Lost? - Francesco  De Giorgio, Jose De Giorgio-Schoorl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In the 1980s, the world of riding, training, and competing with horses took a major turn with the spread of &lt;I&gt;natural horsemanship&lt;/I&gt;, which at its most basic foundation rejects the use of abusive techniques and relies on methods derived from understanding the dynamics of free-roaming horse herds. Since then, equestrians across disciplines have incorporated elements of natural horsemanship into their work. But despite what was certainly an advancement in human-equine interaction that has improved the lives of many horses, Italian animal behaviorists Francesco de Giorgio and Jos&amp;#233; de Giorgio-Schoorl dare to now ask, &lt;I&gt;What if much of what we think we know about horses is, in fact, wrong? What if the premise of herd hierarchy is a myth? What if &amp;#147;conditioning&amp;#8221; the horse&amp;#8217;s behavior in the ways we&amp;#8217;ve grown accustomed is undercutting his potential for development? What if there is another&amp;#151;better&amp;#151;level of partnership to which we can aspire?&lt;/I&gt; Their provocative book takes us into a dimension where we shed our assumptions of leadership, dominance, and control, convincingly showing a way forward that acknowledges that a horse, when allowed, is driven by his own inner motivation to explore and understand the world around him, including his relationship with humans.&lt;/div&gt;" />
