  <title>Arts &amp; Numbers: A Financial Guide for Artists, Writers, Performers, and Other Members of the Creative Class - Elaine Grogan Luttrull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The creative class&amp;#151;artists, actors, writers, musicians, freelancers, dancers, performers, and the like&amp;#151;are known for applying their passion for creative expression to everything they do. Perhaps the one thing that most fills this group with apprehension is the rigid world of numbers. This leads to problems arising from the unconventional financial and business situations of creative professionals, as well as the nonprofit organizations with which they&#39;re often affiliated. Finances, budgeting, and business matters can be dreaded, if not outright ignored, by creatives--to the detriment of their artistic pursuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Author, artist, and CPA Elaine Grogan Luttrull has written &lt;I&gt;Arts &amp; Numbers&lt;/I&gt; to help creative professionals find the same confidence in their financial dealings as in their chosen mode of expression. It is an engaging, accessible guide that covers a variety of must-know topics, such as budgeting, cash management, visual charting, taxes, employment, and business etiquette. In a simple, straightforward style, Luttrull draws examples from smooth-flowing narratives depicting common issues within the arts worlds, as well as from her own personal anecdotes. Unlike stuffy textbooks and patronizing business books, &lt;I&gt;Arts &amp; Numbers&lt;/I&gt; is a lively and artfully done ally in helping creative professionals plan their present financial situations and secure their futures.&lt;/div&gt;" />
