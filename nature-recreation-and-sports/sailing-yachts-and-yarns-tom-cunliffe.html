  <title>Sailing, Yachts and Yarns - Tom Cunliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Nobody captures the magic of sail or conveys the lessons of seamanship like Tom. He&amp;#8217;s one of sailing&amp;#8217;s great raconteurs.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; David Glenn, Editor, Yachting World&lt;p&gt;Tom Cunliffe, star of BBC TV&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;The Boats That Built Britain&lt;/i&gt;, is also Britain&amp;#8217;s leading sailing writer. Here he shares a collection of his most entertaining, outspoken and instructive writing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sailing, Yachts and Yarns&lt;/i&gt; is a selection of his funniest, wisest and most thought-provoking writing from the pages of Yachting Monthly. Tom&amp;#8217;s regular column for this premier sailing magazine gives him free reign to explore a wide range of topics.&lt;p&gt;His love of language and sense of humour shine through as he recalls the wealth of sinners and saints he has met on docksides from Southampton to South America, Greenwich to Greenland and Newtown to New York.&lt;br&gt;Tom has a gift for capturing the magic of sail and finding pearls of practical wisdom in the most unlikely nautical adventures. He is also a great champion for all those who love the freedom of the seas and refuses to mince his words as he stands up to the bullies and bureaucrats that might clog the water with rules and red tape.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sailing, Yachts and Yarns&lt;/i&gt; is a lively miscellany of a wit, wisdom and wonder. It will make you laugh and make you think &amp;#8211; and make you want to cast off to enjoy the delights of life afloat.&lt;p&gt;Tom Cunliffe is a worldwide authority on sailing instruction and an expert on traditional craft. He is the author of more than 25 books and writes for Yachting Monthly, Yachting World and SAIL magazines.&lt;p&gt;" />
