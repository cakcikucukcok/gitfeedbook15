  <title>Cat Paws Through History - Isabel H. Stepanian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspIt all began when Mumzy and Popzy placed me in that chicken coop of a carrier from Saks Fifth Avenue, and off we wentonce again. Little did I know as to what was to befall my poor, furry person. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspBut alas,how was I to suspect as to what awaited me on the other side of the ocean?To say, that it was to be an adventure,was most assuredly an understatement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspHumph!Phffft!What is a cat to do?For at first, unbeknownst to me, I believed that Napoleon was a most delicious pastryBoy!Was I ever wrong! Phffft! Ko-Ko the Cat muttered in a miffed fashion, as he stuck a single whisker in the air in an aristocratic manner, and crossed his forepaws in a regal way. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspAnd thus the reader steps into the mind of Ko-Ko the Cat - an informative and opinionated feline. His views of the philosophies, manners and etiquettes of life are quite enchanting: Filled with laughter and joy. Curious as a cat can be, he teaches and amuses the reader as he experiences history and encounters historical figures while he travels through the world with his human parents." />
