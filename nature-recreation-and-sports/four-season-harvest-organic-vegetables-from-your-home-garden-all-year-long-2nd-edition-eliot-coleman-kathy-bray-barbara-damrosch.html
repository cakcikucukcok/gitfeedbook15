  <title>Four-Season Harvest: Organic Vegetables from Your Home Garden All Year Long, 2nd Edition - Eliot Coleman, Kathy Bray, Barbara Damrosch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you love the joys of eating home-garden vegetables but always thought those joys had to stop at the end of summer, this book is for you. Eliot Coleman introduces the surprising fact that most of the United States has more winter sunshine than the south of France. He shows how North American gardeners can successfully use that sun to raise a wide variety of traditional winter vegetables in backyard cold frames and plastic covered tunnel greenhouses without supplementary heat. Coleman expands upon his own experiences with new ideas learned on a winter-vegetable pilgrimage across the ocean to the acknowledged kingdom of vegetable cuisine, the southern part of France, which lies on the 44th parallel, the same latitude as his farm in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This story of sunshine, weather patterns, old limitations and expectations, and new realities is delightfully innovative in the best gardening tradition. &lt;em&gt;Four-Season Harvest&lt;/em&gt; will have you feasting on fresh produce from your garden all through the winter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To learn more about the possibility of a four-season farm, please visit Coleman&#39;s website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourseasonfarm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; www.fourseasonfarm.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
