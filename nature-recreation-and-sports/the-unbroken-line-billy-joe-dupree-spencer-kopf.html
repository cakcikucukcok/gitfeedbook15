  <title>The Unbroken Line - Billy Joe DuPree, Spencer Kopf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Unbroken Line is the riveting story of how truly heartless the business of professional football was and is  from the poor pension plans and inadequate medical benefits to the greed of union leadership which the authors argue takes advantage of and turns its back on the very individuals who make the game great. At no time in the annals of sports has the timing of a book been more important. &lt;p&gt;
This unique story provides a fascinating inside look at how a group of players and one attorney strategically outwitted the NFL and the Players Union leadership to score an historic and crucial victory for players rights. The year was 1982, a few courageous men stood up to their powerful administrative adversaries when no one else would during the most turbulent time in the history of professional football. What was at stake then and now again in 2010 is the players ability to earn salaries and benefits that are in line with their contributions to their teams. &lt;p&gt;
The authors, former Pro Bowl tight end Billy Joe DuPree and highly respected attorney Spencer Kopf, not only reveal the successful plan that began the end of player exploitation, but they also skillfully compare the peril players faced in 1982 to the heart wrenching situations of present-day, retired union members.
