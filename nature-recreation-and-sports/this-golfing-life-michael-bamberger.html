  <title>This Golfing Life - Michael Bamberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Michael Bamberger, senior writer at &lt;I&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/I&gt; and author of the highly acclaimed Wonderland, has been writing about golf for twenty years. He has lived the game as few others have&amp;#151;from his experience as one of the first white, college-educated caddies in 1985, to hanging out with Arnold Palmer at the Masters. &lt;I&gt;This Golfing Life&lt;/I&gt; brings together Bamberger&amp;#8217;s acclaimed, intimate profiles of stars (Tiger, Jack, and Annika to name a few), as well as the behind-the-scenes people who make the game what it is.  In his last round of golf before an amputation, Bamberger&amp;#8217;s high school golf coach, John Sifaneck, makes his first hole-in-one; John Stark gets Bamberger to relearn the game as a Scotsman; Bob Rubin, a Wall Street master-of-the-universe, builds his own golf course&amp;#151;one so difficult he can&amp;#8217;t break 100 on it; Bruce Edwards continues to caddie for Tom Watson while dying of ALS (Lou Gehrig&amp;#8217;s disease). Bamberger interweaves these stories with his own life in a way that will remind golfers why they love the game.&lt;/div&gt;" />
