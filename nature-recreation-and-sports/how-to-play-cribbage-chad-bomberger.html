      <meta name="description" content="Master Cribbage and Impress Your Friends!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Inside How to Play Cribbage, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover everything you need to know to have fun with this fascinating game:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Basic beginner strategies for quick success and more wins&lt;br /&gt;

How to take the lead &amp;ndash; and reply to your opponent&amp;rsquo;s lead&lt;br /&gt;
Tips for playing cribbage with 3 to 6 players&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Originally invented in the 1600s, cribbage became very popular with sailors (especially in the mid-1900s). During World War II, American submarine crews on long voyages became avid cribbage players. Admiral Richard O&amp;rsquo;Kane was once dealt a perfect hand in a cribbage game &amp;ndash; and his lucky cribbage board has been passed down by generations of submarine captains.&lt;br /&gt;
You can embrace the modern tradition of cribbage by learning the simple and compelling rules of the game. All you need to play is a friend (or a group of friends), a deck of cards, and a cribbage board (a board with 121 holes and pegs for each player).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With this easy-to-understand guidebook, you can quickly pick up the basics of the game, including pegging, counting, and &amp;ldquo;quick counting.&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;ll learn about the &amp;ldquo;perfect 29,&amp;rdquo; how to win with 121 points, and how to &amp;ldquo;skunk&amp;rdquo; your opponents. You&amp;rsquo;ll find out how to use the &amp;ldquo;crib&amp;rdquo; (the namesake of the game) to your advantage &amp;ndash; both as the dealer and a non-dealer. This book even offers sneaky tactics for experienced players, such as using &amp;ldquo;muggins&amp;rdquo; to keep your opponents honest and earn more points!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you read How to Play Cribbage, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover a special bonus chapter which describes Captain&amp;#39;s Cribbage, a variant of 3-person cribbage. In three successive rounds, players take turns teaming up together and acting alone as the &amp;ldquo;captain.&amp;rdquo; This blend of teamwork and competition creates a fun and challenging twist on this classic game!&lt;br /&gt;
