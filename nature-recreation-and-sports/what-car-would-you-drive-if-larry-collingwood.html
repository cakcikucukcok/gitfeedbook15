  <title>What Car Would You Drive If ... ? - Larry Collingwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book brings to readers a close look at car brands that millions are familiar with, such as Ford, Chevrolet, and Buick to name a few. It is written to entertain readers as they reminisce or learn about various models and their manufacturers. In the first part of the question, readers are encouraged to finish it with a clue to identify the name of the model of the car, and a hint is added for further assistance. Sometimes, tips are provided to consider in which chapter the question appears-following in alphabetical order. The second part of each question will give readers multiple choices to help determine the maker of the car in question. For the most part, only one choice will be correct. However, there are a couple of instances where more than one maker has used a model name. In those cases, all manufacturers will be given in the choices." />
