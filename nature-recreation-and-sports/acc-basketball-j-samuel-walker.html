  <title>ACC Basketball - J. Samuel Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the inception of the Atlantic Coast Conference, intense rivalries, legendary coaches, gifted players, and fervent fans have come to define the league&#39;s basketball history. In &lt;i&gt;ACC Basketball&lt;/i&gt;, J. Samuel Walker traces the traditions and the dramatic changes that occurred both on and off the court during the conference&#39;s rise to a preeminent position in college basketball between 1953 and 1972.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walker vividly re-creates the action of nail-biting games and the tensions of bitter recruiting battles without losing sight of the central off-court questions the league wrestled with during these two decades. As basketball became the ACC&#39;s foremost attraction, conference administrators sought to field winning teams while improving academic programs and preserving academic integrity. The ACC also adapted gradually to changes in the postwar South, including, most prominently, the struggle for racial justice during the 1960s. &lt;i&gt;ACC Basketball&lt;/i&gt; is a lively, entertaining account of coaches&#39; flair (and antics), players&#39; artistry, a major point-shaving scandal, and the gradually more evenly matched struggle for dominance in one of college basketball&#39;s strongest conferences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
