  <title>The Tetris Effect - Dan Ackerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive story of a game so great, even the Cold War couldn&#39;t stop it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetris is perhaps the most instantly recognizable, popular video game ever made. But how did an obscure Soviet programmer, working on frail, antiquated computers, create a product which has now earned nearly 1 billion in sales? How did a makeshift game turn into a worldwide sensation, which has been displayed at the Museum of Modern Art, inspired a big-budget sci-fi movie, and been played in outer space?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quiet but brilliant young man, Alexey Pajitnov had long nurtured a love for the obscure puzzle game pentominoes, and became obsessed with turning it into a computer game. Little did he know that the project that he labored on alone, hour after hour, would soon become the most addictive game ever made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this fast-paced business story, reporter Dan Ackerman reveals how Tetris became one of the world&#39;s first viral hits, passed from player to player, eventually breaking through the Iron Curtain into the West. British, American, and Japanese moguls waged a bitter fight over the rights, sending their fixers racing around the globe to secure backroom deals, while a secretive Soviet organization named ELORG chased down the game&#39;s growing global profits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tetris Effect&lt;/i&gt; is an homage to both creator and creation, and a must-read for anyone who&#39;s ever played the game-which is to say everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
