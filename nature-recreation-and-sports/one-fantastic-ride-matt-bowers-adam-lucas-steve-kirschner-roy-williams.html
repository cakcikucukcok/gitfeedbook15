  <title>One Fantastic Ride - Matt Bowers, Adam Lucas, Steve Kirschner, Roy Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;One Fantastic Ride&lt;/i&gt; is a behind-the-scenes portrait of the unforgettable journey to the University of North Carolina&#39;s 2009 basketball national championship, the program&#39;s fifth NCAA Tournament title. Adam Lucas, Steve Kirschner, and Matt Bowers were with the Tar Heels every step of the way, interviewing coaches, players, and staff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the 2008-09 season opened, national pundits widely considered the Tar Heels the hands-down favorite to win the title. But injuries to key players, surprising midseason losses, and formidable ACC competition made the ride bumpier than expected. In the crucial last month of the season, however, a veteran team drew on their experience--and subtle adjustments by coaches and players--to achieve the goal they&#39;d set for themselves after their disappointing defeat in the 2008 Final Four. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a season-in-the-life of a perennially excellent program, this book captures the crowning achievement of a senior class that exemplified the proud tradition of Carolina Basketball, both on and off the court. They became the most decorated class in UNC Basketball history while enjoying every aspect of their Tar Heel experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With &quot;Thoughts for the Day&quot; taken directly from Carolina Basketball practice plans and more than 200 color photographs, this book is a unique keepsake for fans everywhere. Full of insights from players and coaches, &lt;i&gt;One Fantastic Ride&lt;/i&gt; takes an intimate look at how the Tar Heels pulled it all together to come out on top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
