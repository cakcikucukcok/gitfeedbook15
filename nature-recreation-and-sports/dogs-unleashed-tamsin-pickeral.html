  <title>Dogs Unleashed - Tamsin Pickeral</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;One glance around the local park will confirm that man&amp;#8217;s best friend comes in many varieties. As the first animal domesticated by humans, dogs have been selectively bred for tens of thousands of years to be herders, hunters, guard dogs, and friends. The result is a plethora of breeds that are as different as the pint-sized chihuahua and the massive St. Bernard.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now there is a guide to each of them. &lt;I&gt;Dogs Unleashed&lt;/I&gt; contains all the information required to differentiate breeds of canine. From the standard poodle to the Finnish spritz, readers will become experts of identification. Alongside beautiful photography, discover information on conformation, history, temperament, health risks, and more. This book even contains a section on today&amp;#8217;s designer breeds like the labradoodle, the puggle, and the cockapoo. Ideal for researching a new family pet, or for general knowledge, this book reveals which dogs are the most expensive to keep, which are the best swimmers, and which breed has the longest life expectancy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A complete compendium of canine varieties, &lt;I&gt;Dogs Unleashed&lt;/I&gt; is one book that is sure to keep tails wagging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
