  <title>Black Belt Fitness for Life: A 7-Week Plan to Achieve Lifelong Wellness - Grandmaster Tae Sun Kang, Andrew Federici, Michael Imperioli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;There&#39;s something to martial arts and especially the way Grandmaster Kang teaches it that addresses not just the body and fitness, but addresses the mind and addresses your approach to life.&quot; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;from the foreword by Michael Imperioli, award-winning actor&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Black Belt Fitness for Life&lt;/I&gt;, Grandmaster Tae Sun Kang applies his four decades of experience to guide you through an innovative method of fitness using Taekwondo principles. Whether you&#39;re a beginner or veteran to stretching and exercise, you can easily follow Grandmaster Kang&#39;s 7-week routine based on the belt system of Taekwondo, an ancient Korean martial art. With each week of the regimen, you will learn new skills and techniques that culminate in mastery of the techniques necessary to continue exercising and eating right for life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Through the use of Taekwondo stretches and movements, this black belt &quot;Combined Dynamic Stretching&quot; method will improve your flexibility and balance, stamina and strength, as well as your focus and mental health. You&#39;ll stretch multiple parts of your body at the same time, improving circulation and building mental strength while warming up to minimize injuries. As part of his holistic approach to health and fitness, Grandmaster Kang also outlines an eating plan designed to help you lose weight naturally. Unlike extreme diets and workouts that emphasize drastic results quickly, the Grandmaster&#39;s approach is a balanced, easy-to-follow, and&amp;#151;most importantly&amp;#151;realistic plan designed for your life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Friend and longtime student of Grandmaster Kang, actor Michael Imperioli wrote the foreword for the book and shares his experience in training under Grandmaster, as well as the benefits he has received in following Grandmaster&#39;s philosophy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
