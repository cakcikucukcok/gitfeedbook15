  <title>Soccer Without Borders - Erik Kirschbaum, J端rgen Klinsmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A GAME-CHANGING AND FASCINATING BOOK ON HOW TO USE WISDOM FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO CREATE A LASTING, POWERFUL SOCCER TEAM, BY ONE OF THE SPORT&#39;S MOST ICONIC AND EFFECTIVE COACHES &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurgen Klinsmann, head coach of the U.S. men&#39;s national soccer team, has become a household name after the United States&#39; unprecedentedly strong run at the 2014 World Cup. Klinsmann&#39;s reputation is that of a maverick, of an unconventional leader who isn&#39;t afraid to challenge traditional notions of coaching, and who will breathe new life into foundering programs through sometimes unpopular -but resoundingly successful -new tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Soccer Without Borders&lt;/i&gt;, journalist Erik Kirschbaum lays out Klinsmann&#39;s vision for making the U.S. men&#39;s soccer team a dominant world power for the first time in its history. Featuring fascinating insights gleaned from Klinsmann&#39;s decades of dedicated study - both as a professional striker and as coach of the German national team - this book is an immersive and unparalleled road map for how to build a winning team in the most competitive professional sport on the globe, as well as an infectious tribute to &quot;the most beautiful game&quot; by one of its most adroit students.&lt;/p&gt;" />
