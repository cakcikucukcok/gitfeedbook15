  <title>Colorado Warbird Survivors 2001 - Harold A. Skaarup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this handbook is to provide aviation enthusiasts with a simple checklist on where to find the surviving retired military aircraft that are preserved in the state of Colorado.  &lt;p&gt;The majority of the Colorado Warbird Survivors can be viewed at the Pueblo Weisbrod Air Museum, the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver, on the grounds of Buckley Air Force Base in Denver, on the grounds of the Peterson Air and Space Museum and on the grounds of the United States Air Force Academy, both located in Colorado Springs.  Various gate guards in various cities in the state are also listed.
&lt;p&gt;The museum staffs and volunteer organizations in Colorado have done a particularly good job of preserving the great variety of American combat veteran aircraft, illustrated here.  Hopefully, as more aircraft are recovered from their crash sites in the bush and restored, traded or brought back from private owners, that they too will be added to the record.  &lt;p&gt;The book lists the aircraft alphabetically by manufacturer, number and type.  This list is also appended with a brief summary of the aircraft presently on display within the state and a bit of its history in the US military." />
