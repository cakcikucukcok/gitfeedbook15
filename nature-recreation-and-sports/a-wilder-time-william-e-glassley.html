  <title>A Wilder Time - William E. Glassley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;Very few people have spent as much time as William E. Glassley in such deep wilderness. So it would behoove us to pay attention even if he had not brought back such a fascinating, lovely, and useful set of observations. This is a remarkable book.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Bill McKibben&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;The End of Nature&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Oil and Honey&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;The profound mystery of our living Earth saturates this memorable book.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;John Elder&lt;/B&gt;, coeditor of &lt;I&gt;The Norton Book of Nature Writing&lt;/I&gt; and author of &lt;I&gt;Picking Up the Flute&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Greenland, one of the last truly wild places, contains a treasure trove of information on Earth&amp;#8217;s early history embedded in its pristine landscape. Over numerous seasons, William E. Glassley and two fellow geologists traveled there to collect samples and observe rock formations for evidence to prove a contested theory that plate tectonics, the movement of Earth&amp;#8217;s crust over its molten core, is a much more ancient process than some believed. As their research drove the scientists ever farther into regions barely explored by humans for millennia&amp;#151;if ever&amp;#151;Glassley encountered wondrous creatures and natural phenomena that gave him unexpected insight into the origins of myth, the virtues and boundaries of science, and the importance of seeking the wilderness within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An invitation to experience a breathtaking place and the fascinating science behind its creation, &lt;I&gt;A Wilder Time&lt;/I&gt; is nature writing at its best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;William E. Glassley&lt;/B&gt; is a geologist at the University of California, Davis, and an emeritus researcher at Aarhus University, Denmark, focusing on the evolution of continents and the processes that energize them. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
