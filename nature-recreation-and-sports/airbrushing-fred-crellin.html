  <title>Airbrushing - Fred Crellin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Airbrushing is a versatile and exciting art. The technique has been used for some 150 years, and is now finding ever more applications. This beautiful book explains how to use an airbrush. It looks at the fundamentals of how to get started, advises on maintenance of the tool and then gives step-by-step examples of a range of projects. With troubleshooting tips throughout, it enables you to get the most from your airbrush and create beautiful pieces with a professional finish. Topics covered include: Technical illustration; Watercolour landscapes; Portraits; Painting scale models; Cake decorating; T-shirts and leather; Custom painting vehicles. &#39;To those who airbrush the joys are well known, as well of course, as the trials and tribulations of managing the instrument itself. The airbrush student has to learn significant new skills - to master not only colour and shade, but also air pressure, paint consistency and the diverse ways of masking and shading that can help to achieve such wonderful results.&#39; Professor Andy Penaluna. This step-by-step guide to techniques and maintenance explains how to run and maintain an airbrush and gives step-by-step examples of a range of projects. Every art or decorating form can use airbrushing including fine art, fabric printing, leatherwork and much, much more. Superbly illustrated with 399 colour photographs. Fred Crellin runs not only his own airbrushing company specializing in custom painting, portraits and cartoons but also the Artimagination Airbrush School." />
