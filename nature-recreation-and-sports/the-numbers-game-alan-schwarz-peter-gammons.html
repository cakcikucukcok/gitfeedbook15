  <title>The Numbers Game - Alan Schwarz, Peter Gammons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most baseball fans, players and even team executives assume that the National Pastime&#39;s infatuation with statistics is simply a byproduct of the information age, a phenomenon that blossomed only after the arrival of Bill James and computers in the 1980s. They couldn&#39;t be more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this unprecedented new book, Alan Schwarz - whom bestselling &lt;i&gt;Moneyball&lt;/i&gt; author Michael Lewis calls &quot;one of today&#39;s best baseball journalists&quot; - provides the first-ever history of baseball statistics, showing how baseball and its numbers have been inseparable ever since the pastime&#39;s birth in 1845. He tells the history of this obsession through the lives of the people who felt it most: Henry Chadwick, the 19th-century writer who invented the first box score and harped endlessly about which statistics mattered and which did not; Allan Roth, Branch Rickey&#39;s right-hand numbers man with the late-1940s Brooklyn Dodgers; Earnshaw Cook, a scientist and Manhattan Project veteran who retired to pursue inventing the perfect baseball statistic; John Dewan, a former Strat-O-Matic maven who built STATS Inc. into a multimillion-dollar powerhouse for statistics over the Internet; and dozens more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every baseball fan for 150 years has been drawn to the game by its statistics, whether through newspaper box scores, the backs of Topps baseball cards, &lt;i&gt;The Baseball Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;, or fantasy leagues. Today&#39;s most ardent stat scientists, known as &quot;sabermetricians,&quot; spend hundreds of hours coming up with new ways to capture the game in numbers, and engage in holy wars over which statistics are best. Some of these men - and women -- are even being hired by major league teams to bring an understanding of statistics to a sport that for so long shunned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Schwarz paints a history not just of baseball statistics, but of the soul of the sport itself. &lt;i&gt;The Numbers Game&lt;/i&gt; will be an invaluable part of any fan&#39;s library and go down as one of the sport&#39;s classic books.&lt;/p&gt;" />
