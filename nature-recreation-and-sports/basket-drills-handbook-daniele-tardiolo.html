  <title>Basket Drills Handbook - Daniele Tardiolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the &amp;lsquo;80s, when my generation of coaches was being initiated to this career,&amp;nbsp;drills were invested of excessive importance: the challenge was that of finding, or&amp;nbsp;creating, the most spectacular, choreographic drills.&amp;nbsp;e more complex the drill, the more, it seemed, it was able to satisfy our didactic&amp;nbsp;aims, with the result that more time was spent explaining and adjusting the drill&amp;nbsp;itself rather than training in the skills said drill was supposed to improve.&amp;nbsp;Indeed, we often talked about &amp;lsquo;the drills of this or that coach&amp;rsquo;, as opposed to their basketball philosophy, in a way almost giving a great significance to the box while&amp;nbsp;none to its content.&amp;nbsp;It took us a long time to realise that drills are a mere tool in the hands of the coach,&amp;nbsp;and not an end in themselves. Instead, our end should be the teaching of the game,&amp;nbsp;and, so, thankfully, we have shifted from choreographic drills to functional ones,&amp;nbsp;drawn from the game itself and made simple and adequate to the development of&amp;nbsp;certain didactic objectives.&amp;nbsp;Thus, we welcome this handbook created by coach Daniele Tardiolo. It gathers, in&lt;br /&gt;
a well?structured manner, drills responding to the needs of the coach, and adds&amp;nbsp;value to the drill as a tool available to all coaches, both seasoned and&amp;nbsp;inexperienced.&lt;br /&gt;
It is not the choice of a drill to make a coach better, or more successful, but, rather, this or her ability to adapt it and use it appropriately. After all, coaches are much like&amp;nbsp;five?star chefs, who can prepare delicious dishes with just a few, genuine ingredients. Coach Tardiolo&amp;rsquo;s book provides the ingredients, leaving to the readers&amp;nbsp;the freedom to choose their favourite recipe." />
