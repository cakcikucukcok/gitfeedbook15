  <title>Horses with a Mission - Allen Anderson, Linda Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With twenty-one dramatic true stories of courageous, loyal, and loving horses who found their life&#39;s purpose, this book reveals the wonders possible when both humans and horses are encouraged and allowed to follow their best instincts. The heroic equines you will meet include:
Molly, a pony who survived Hurricane Katrina and the loss of a leg, who spreads her message of hope to disabled children. Her story went viral with coverage on the Internet, in the New York Times, and on the CBS Evening News.
Sankofa, an Arabian stallion, who made it possible for social studies teacher Miles J. Dean to complete a cross-country journey in tribute to African American ancestors. Millions of adults and schoolchildren followed their odyssey as Miles and Sankofa made history come alive. 
Diana, a wild horse of the rare Gila herd, who proved to be a proud and resourceful lead mare who protected her herd and taught the great lesson of forgiveness.
Butch, a retired gelding, who showed such an unswerving belief in a profoundly mentally retarded girl that he restored a mother&#39;s hopes for her child&#39;s future." />
