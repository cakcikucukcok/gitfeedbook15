  <title>Practical Ballistics - Lewis Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This fascinating book starts with the basics, going back to the days of muzzle loading before considering the various attempts made over the centuries to improve the bullet. It moves on to examine the development of the cartridge right up to the present day, and provides the reader with a clear understanding of the principles governing the bullet&#39;s flight. Topics covered include the factors that influence ballistic performance and accuracy; &#39;internal ballistics&#39; (factors influencing performance whilst the bullet is still in the barrel) and &#39;external ballistics&#39; (factors affecting the bullet&#39;s flight when it leaves the barrel). Simple formulae are included to enhance the understanding of the principles involved. The book also describes a number of interesting experiments concerning performance and accuracy and presents the results. It aims to assist those enthusiasts who make their own bullets by analysing faults that have an impact on accuracy and covers both rifled firearms and smooth-bore guns.Includes a glossary that incorporates rifle terminology and those terms specific to the shotgun, and is superbly illustrated with over 100 colour photographs." />
