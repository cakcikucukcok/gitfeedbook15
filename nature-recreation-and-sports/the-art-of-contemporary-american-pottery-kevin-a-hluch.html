  <title>The Art of Contemporary American Pottery - Kevin A. Hluch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beauty will always reside in the eye of the beholder, but what about the fine line between beauty and functionality? Can a purely utilitarian form, such as a simple pot, vase, or plate, truly be considered a great work of art?&lt;p&gt;    In &lt;i&gt;The Art of Contemporary American Pottery&lt;/i&gt;, author Kevin A Hluch takes up the challenge of addressing this debate. Hluch, who examines pottery from a unique perspective as historian, scholar and connoisseur, finds as much meaning and nobility in a thoughtfully crafted clay vessel as he does in a masterpiece painting.&lt;p&gt;    There are many reasons why a good pot is a good pot. Some reasons are obvious. Some are subtle. Some only reveal themselves when you know how to look. With the help of more than 200 beautiful color photos featuring the world of the country&#39;s best utilitarian potters, and a lengthy list of artists and galleries, Hluch does more than just talk about how great pottery is made. He talks about what makes great pottery." />
