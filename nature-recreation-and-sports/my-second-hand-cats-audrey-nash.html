He has a very loud demanding miaow, meant to get his human servants moving fast, and then gives a delightful gruff one when he has been obliged. You will also meet Thatch, once the Gloucester Prison cat, who used to pace up and down the garden path like a prisoner on exercise. In reading about them all, I trust you will experience some of theenjoyment they have brought to us. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
