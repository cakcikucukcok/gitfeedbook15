  <title>Blackjack Ko with Table of Critical Running Counts - Bj Analyst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Traditional blackjack card counting wisdom is that the selected count should be balanced and if side counts are kept they must be separately tracked by rank which rank is not included in the primary count. This book will dispel these myths as the primary count selected for blackjack is the KO count and for Spanish 21 is the Hi-Low both of which are unbalanced with a pivot of a true count of four and so calculation of true counts of four or more when big bets are made are relatively insensitive to errors in estimated decks played as compared to balanced counts which have a pivot of zero. Also plus minus side counts which are exact and easy to keep and the ranks in the side counts may also be counted in the primary count. All strategy changes are made using addition, subtraction and multiplication and then compared to a critical running count so that no division is necessary. The primary unbalanced counts are ideal for the shoe game, plus minus balanced side counts are easy to use, true counts of four or more are relatively insensitive to errors in estimating decks played and finally the counts are very powerful as measured by correlation coefficients between the tagged value of the derived counts and the effects of removal for each strategic situation." />
