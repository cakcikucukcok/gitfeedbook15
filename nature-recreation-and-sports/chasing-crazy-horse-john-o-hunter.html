      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Crazy Horse was the mystic Lakota warrior who inspired his braves by his daring leadership, but he was not brutal or cruel.

&lt;p&gt;He will be remembered now in the mountain sculpture by Korczak Ziolkowski in the Black Hills of South Dakota, the largest monument we have in America, and by the elegant line of the poet, Stephen Spender: Born of the sun he traveled a short while towards the sun and left the vivid air signed with his honor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
