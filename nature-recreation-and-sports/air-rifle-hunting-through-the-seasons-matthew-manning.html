  <title>Air Rifle Hunting Through the Seasons - Matthew Manning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Mathew Manning combines a good deal of practical information and enjoyable, anecdotal text to give the reader a pleasurable insight into the world of air rifle hunting. In&amp;amp;#160;Air Rifle Hunting Through the Seasons, Mathew Manning has compiled a guide to air rifle hunting skills and techniques that is a must-have for anyone who wants to get the most from their airgun shooting and stay one step ahead of their quarry. The book covers the vast array of hunting techniques used by one of the country&amp;amp;#8217;s leading shooting writers. Whether controlling pests on the farm or hunting meat for the pot, the airgun shooter has to pit his wits against the finely tuned senses of wild creatures that run the gauntlet of survival on a daily basis. Through this book, Mathew Manning shares his wealth of experience to help you tip the odds in your favour. The title covers in detail the skills of fieldcraft - the hunter&amp;amp;#8217;s deadliest weapon. Join Mathew for a year in the countryside and learn how to read the signs provided by nature and then make the right decisions to enjoy consistent success in the field. Mathew describes more than thirty hunting scenarios encountered through the year, from decoying crows and magpies and hide shooting for pigeons to long-range rabbiting and woodland squirrel control. He offers easy-to-follow guidance on how to pre-empt the habits of quarry species along with the various techniques and tactics he uses to exploit hunting opportunities throughout the year. There are also helpful notes on game preparation and a selection of favourite recipes, including Pigeon Pasties and Rabbit with Apple and Cider.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
