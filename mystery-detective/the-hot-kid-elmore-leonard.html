  <title>The Hot Kid - Elmore Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carlos Webster was fifteen in the fall of 1921 the first time he came face-to-face with a nationally known criminal. A few weeks later, he killed his first man&amp;#8212a cattle thief who was rustling his dad&#39;s stock. Now Carlos, called Carl, is the hot kid of the U.S. Marshals Service, one of the elite manhunters currently chasing the likes of Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Pretty Boy Floyd across America&#39;s Depression-ravaged heartland. Carl wants to be the country&#39;s most famous lawman. Jack Belmont, the bent son of an oil millionaire, wants to be public enemy number one. Tony Antonelli of &lt;em&gt;True Detective&lt;/em&gt; magazine wants to write about this world of cops and robbers, molls and speakeasies from perilously close up. Then there are the hot dames&amp;#8212Louly and Elodie&amp;#8212hooking their schemes and dreams onto dangerous men. And before the gunsmoke clears, everybody just might end up getting exactly what he or she wished for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
