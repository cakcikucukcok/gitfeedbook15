  <title>The Book of Kills - Ralph McInerny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prior to the kidnapping of several school administrators and the desecration of headstones in the Cedar Grove Cemetery, the University of Notre Dame&#39;s biggest worry had seemed to be this season&#39;s challenging football schedule. But these &quot;pranks&quot; are getting more and more serious. Then, Orion Plant, an eccentric scholar in the history program, began attracting negative media attention by claiming the university founder, Father Edward Sorin, stole the land on which the school sits from Native Americans. All in all, it&#39;s more than the board of trustees can handle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potentially costly lawsuit, embarrassing publicity, and a scandalous half-time prank broadcast on national television, cause university chancellor Father Bloom to turn to detective Philip Knight and his brother, brilliant philosophy professor Roger Knight, for help. But just as the brothers dig into the investigation, the scholar turns up dead, an Indian headdress wrapped around his bloody head. The South Bend police department is stumped, leaving the Knights once again to bring the killer to justice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cleverly constructed and witty installment from one of the genre&#39;s masters, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Kills&lt;/i&gt; is a delightfully sinister stroll through the hallowed halls of academia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
