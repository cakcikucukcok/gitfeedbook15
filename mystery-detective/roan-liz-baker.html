  <title>Roan - Liz Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Philadelphia born and bred, Mattie McCoy, was sassy, cool, confident and sexy. Her former career of repossessing autos kept her mentally and physically in shape for sleuthing in an early twentieth-century, Victorian mansion. She didn&#39;t need anyone, nor did she want anyone, to keep her from her search for her grandfather&#39;s fortune.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But then, there was that one obstacle; that Texas tin star and his two deputies. Well, that cowboy was just like any other man. He could easily be seduced and lied to. He had his tiny brain in his Levis, but Mattie knew she had what was needed to melt those cold, ice-blue slits on his bronzed face.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And that dark, foreboding, dreary mansion was just plain evil. It held too many mysteries, too many secret passageways and the aroma of impending death. What clues could be found prowling around in there? And what did that sheriff know that he wasn&#39;t telling?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All Mattie and her friends wanted was a little adventure. They got that and a whole lot more.&lt;/P&gt;
