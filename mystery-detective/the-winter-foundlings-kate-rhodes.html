  <title>The Winter Foundlings - Kate Rhodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Psychologist Alice Quentin has been looking forward to a break from her hectic London life. She has vowed to stay clear of police work. The previous cases she helped the police with have left her scarred. So, when Alice is given the rare opportunity to study treatment methods at Northwood high-security hospital outside of London, she is eager to get to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then a young girl is discovered, dressed all in white, on the steps of the Foundling Museum. Four girls have recently gone missing in North London--this is the third to be found, dead. The fourth may still be alive, and Alice Quentin may be able to help. Britain&#39;s most prolific child killer, Louis Kinsella, has been locked up in Northwood for over a decade. Yet, these recent kidnappings and murders are clearly connected to Kinsella&#39;s earlier crimes. It seems that someone is continuing where he left off. So, when Detective Don Burns comes asking for Alice&#39;s help, how can she refuse? Alice will do anything to help save a child--even if that means forming a relationship with a charismatic, ruthless murderer. But Kinsella is slow to give away his secrets, and time is running out for the latest kidnap victim, who is simply trying to survive. In her quest to save a life, Alice finds she has put her own life on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Winter Foundling &lt;/i&gt;is Kate Rhode&#39;s exciting thriller featuring Alice Quentin following &lt;i&gt;Crossbones Yard &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;A Killing of Angels. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
