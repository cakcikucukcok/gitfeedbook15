  <title>Who Killed Amanda - Florence Joanne Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gabe Faldare
Meet Gabes five kids: Davey, aged forty. His first wife divorced him. He doesnt know why. His second wife was murdered in 1994. Jarry, aged thirty-nine. His wife, Rae, was murdered 1998. Merry Janelle, aged thirty-six. Married to Holin Silver; they raise house dogs. Sara Jane, aged thirty-three. She is a detective with GPD, once married to Lee Sharol, who was murdered in 2001. And Jed, aged twenty-nine. His wife, Deanna, was murdered, along with their unborn baby in 2001.
Too many women in the Faldare family have been either molested or murdered. Silas Faldare goes to FBI headquarters in Cleveland, hoping the director can spare someone to look into the problem. There have also been other murders connected to the family that needs looked into. And while Silas, ninety-four years old, searched on his computer, he found twenty-eight other women who had been murdered over a five-year period over several Northern Ohio counties. They were never solved.
Silas gave all that information to Director Greer.
FBI Director Carson Greer sends in Gideon Granger, former FBI agent recently retired, recovering from being shot three times, now reinstated for this job as undercover detective with the Garrettsville, Ohio, Police Department.
Can Granger solve the cold cases?
And find out who killed Amanda Stranton?" />
