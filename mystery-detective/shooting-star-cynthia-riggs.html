  <title>Shooting Star - Cynthia Riggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Shooting Star,&lt;/i&gt; ninety-two-year-old poet Victoria Trumbull becomes embroiled in controversy at the community theater on Martha&#39;s Vineyard. The new artistic director has announced plans to replace local amateur talent with off-Island professionals, and the cast and crew react murderously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria intended the theater&#39;s current production, her adaptation of &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein,&lt;/i&gt; by Mary Shelley, to debunk the common farcical movie-monster interpretation by returning to Shelley&#39;s original serious commentary on the Industrial Revolution. However, after the night of the dress rehearsal, Victoria loses control over the production, and her drama begins to take a strange course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that night, the eight-year-old boy playing the part of Frankenstein&#39;s young brother disappears, and before a search can begin, a killer strikes. The Vineyard&#39;s police forces mobilize for an Island-wide search. In the original story of Frankenstein, the boy is the first victim of the monster, and Victoria fears that a copycat killer is following her playscript. She determines to find the missing boy and track down the killer before more deaths occur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with familiar Island characters from her previous books, the author introduces a cast of new and often eccentric players. &lt;i&gt;Shooting Star,&lt;/i&gt; the seventh book in the Martha&#39;s Vineyard mystery series, explores the rich setting of the Island that author Cynthia Riggs knows well, from the rose-covered Dukes County jail on Edgartown&#39;s Main Street to the quaint ferry terminal in Oak Bluffs. It&#39;s a delightful read that both fans and newcomers to the series will be sure to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
