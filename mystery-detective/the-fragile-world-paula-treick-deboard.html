  <title>The Fragile World - Paula Treick DeBoard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;From the author of stunning debut &lt;em&gt;The Mourning Hours&lt;/em&gt; comes a powerful new novel that explores every parent&#39;s worst nightmare…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Kaufmans have always considered themselves a normal, happy family. Curtis is a physics teacher at a local high school. His wife, Kathleen, restores furniture for upscale boutiques. Daniel is away at college on a prestigious music scholarship, and twelve-year-old Olivia is a happy-go-lucky kid whose biggest concern is passing her next math test.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And then comes the middle-of-the-night phone call that changes everything. Daniel has been killed in what the police are calling a &quot;freak&quot; road accident, and the remaining Kaufmans are left to flounder in their grief.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The anguish of Daniel&#39;s death is isolating, and it&#39;s not long before this once-perfect family finds itself falling apart. As time passes and the wound refuses to heal, Curtis becomes obsessed with the idea of revenge, a growing mania that leads him to pack up his life and his anxious teenage daughter and set out on a collision course to right a wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An emotionally charged novel, &lt;em&gt;The Fragile World&lt;/em&gt; is a journey through America&#39;s heartland and a family&#39;s brightest and darkest moments, exploring the devastating pain of losing a child and the beauty of finding the way back to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Paula Treick DeBoard&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;Heart-stopping. A gripping read that delivers a beautiful reminder of the resilience of love.&#39; - Karen Brown, author of The Longings of Wayward Girls&lt;/p&gt;
