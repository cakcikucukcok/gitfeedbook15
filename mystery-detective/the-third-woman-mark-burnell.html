  <title>The Third Woman - Mark Burnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Burnell&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Third Woman&lt;/i&gt; is a Stephanie Patrick Thriller, continuing the story of the international spy from &lt;i&gt;The Rhythm Section&lt;/i&gt;, the basis of the major motion picture from the producers of the James Bond film series, starring Blake Lively and Jude Law.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Petra was an identity handed to Stephanie. A shell to inhabit. And in those days there had been a boss. A man who had regulated every aspect of her life. But as time passed, flesh and fabric had merged and Stephanie had &lt;/i&gt;become &lt;i&gt;Petra. Or was it the other way around?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Icily professional, Stephanie has been living life as her alias--the professional terrorist Petra--to the fullest. Having completed an intelligence contract in St. Petersburg she returns home, but civilian life eludes her when she is lured to France by the call of a friend in need. In Paris, a bomb blast triggers a chain of events which contaminates every aspect of Stephanie&#39;s life. It&#39;s clear that she&#39;s been betrayed. But by whom? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before she can run from the threat, she must identify it. Stephanie saves herself by taking a hostage, but soon the tension between captive and captor accelerates dangerously beyond her control. As powers shift critically, Stephanie struggles to maintain Petra&#39;s professional cool, and to hold herself together. Ultimately, she&#39;s the only one who can save them--but will it be at the price of the hostage&#39;s life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
