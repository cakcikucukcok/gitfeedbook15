  <title>Red Star Burning - Brian Freemantle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Britain&#39;s MI5 tolerates Charlie Muffin because he&#39;s their best field agent. What none of his colleagues knows, though, is that he is married to Natalia Fedova, a colonel in the FSB, the Russian intelligence successor to the KGB. It&#39;s a secret that could land her in front of a firing squad, and him in jail for life. Worst of all, their daughter would then end up in a Russian state orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a frantic call from Natalia has brought their secret out, and Charlie must lead a combined MI5/MI6 mission to rescue her. He soon realizes that his higher-ups have other priorities than his family&#39;s safety. Charlie will have to outwit not just the Russians but his own government as well to protect the lives of his wife and child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clever, unpredictable, and exciting, &lt;i&gt;Red Star Burning &lt;/i&gt;shows why Brian Freemantle has been widely praised as one of the greatest living espionage novelists.&lt;/p&gt;" />
