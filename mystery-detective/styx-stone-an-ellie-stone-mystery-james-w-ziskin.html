  <title>Styx &amp; Stone: An Ellie Stone Mystery - James W. Ziskin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ellie Stone is a professed modern girl in 1960s&#39; New York City, playing by her own rules and breaking boundaries while searching for a killer among the renowned scholars in Columbia University&#39;s Italian Department. &quot;If you were a man, you&#39;d make a good detective.&quot; Ellie Stone is sure that Sgt. McKeever meant that as a compliment, but that identity-a girl wanting to do a man&#39;s job-has throttled her for too long. It&#39;s 1960, and Ellie doesn&#39;t want to blaze any trails for women; she just wants to be a reporter, one who doesn&#39;t need to swat hands off her behind at every turn. Adrift in her career, Ellie is back in New York City after receiving news that her estranged father, a renowned Dante scholar and distinguished professor, is near death after a savage bludgeoning in his home. The police suspect a routine burglary, but Ellie has her doubts. When a second attempt is made on her father&#39;s life, in the form of an &quot;accident&quot; in the hospital&#39;s ICU, Ellie&#39;s suspicions are confirmed. Then another professor turns up dead, and Ellie&#39;s investigation turns to her father&#39;s university colleagues, their ambitions, jealousies, and secret lives. Ellie embarks on a thorny journey of discovery and reconciliation, as she pursues an investigation that offers her both a chance at redemption in her father&#39;s eyes, and the risk of losing him forever." />
