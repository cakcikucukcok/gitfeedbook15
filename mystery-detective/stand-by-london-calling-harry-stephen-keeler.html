  <title>Stand By -- London Calling! - Harry Stephen Keeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;My guiltiest pleasure is Harry Stephen Keeler. He may been the greatest bad writer America has ever produced. Or perhaps the worst great writer. I do not know. There are few faults you can accuse him of that he is not guilty of. But I love him.&quot; -- Neil Gaiman&lt;P&gt;
An unholy love! That&#39;s what young Erlys Janway found herself in the throes of as she awaits word from her brother, Pell Barneyfield, as to whether they are truly blood-related. If he can come up with the proof they&#39;re not related -- and then make it to Foleysburg, where MacWhorter&#39;s traveling circus is camped -- then Erlys won&#39;t be compelled to marry Golden-Tongue, the circus barker. But first Pell&#39;ll have to traverse Old Twistibus, a road so crooked they gave it a name. In the meantime, Angus MacWhorter, kindly owner of the circus, is offered $1000 for a $10 diorama of a hanged fish with a crown. What&#39;s with that? Only the answer to all of the riddles of this classic 1953 tale, the last Keeler published in English during his lifetime." />
