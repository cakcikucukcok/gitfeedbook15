  <title>We Live and Walk Among You - Rob Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The moment that many Americans fear most is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrorists have just detonated a nuclear bomb on US soil, causing horrifying carnage, massive destruction, and nationwide panic. The explosion triggers an earthquake of epic proportions, and catastrophic ?ooding follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As horri?c as the attack is, it is only the ?rst in a series planned by a terrorist organization called the Sons of Allah. The new leader of this terrorist group emerges, and his brutal actions quickly bring the American economy to its knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second terrorist organization, with homegrown camps across the United States, is uncovered. The FBI, Homeland Security, and the nations local law enforcement teams must work in tandem in the hope of defeating their mutual enemy. But in a world now ?lled with blinding mania and fear, could this be accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the panic, a high-pro?le couple is kidnapped. He is the CEO of a major oil company and his wife is the daughter of the attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Americans across the country fear for their own lives, Capitol Hill feels handcu?ed. Once again, top US o?cials turn to a team of elite CIA operatives as Americas only hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
