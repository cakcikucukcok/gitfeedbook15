Because of the enemies he&#39;s accumulated over the years, Heyworth stipulated in his will detailed plans for an amateur investigation to take place in the event of his death. When Heyworth is found dead in his own library, Evie Randall, Heyworth&#39;s possible illegitimate daughter who has lived on the Heyworth estate ever since her mother, Heyworth&#39;s former housekeeper died, becomes the primary suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle detective Max Galloway is sent to find out the truth and is unwittingly drawn to Evie. But the real murderer is closing in and is determined to eliminate anything or anyone standing in the way of collecting millions.
