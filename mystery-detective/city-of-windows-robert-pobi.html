  <title>City of Windows - Robert Pobi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;City of Windows&lt;/i&gt; is moving, breathtaking--a great entertainment.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A tough, wise, knowing narrative voice, a great plot, a great setting, and even better characters -- I loved this.&quot; --Lee Child, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the tradition of Jeffery Deaver&#39;s Lincoln Rhyme and David Baldacci&#39;s Amos Decker, Robert Pobi&#39;s &lt;/i&gt;City of Windows&lt;i&gt; introduces Lucas Page, a brilliant, reluctant investigator, matching wits with a skilled, invisible killer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the worst blizzard in memory, an FBI agent in a moving SUV in New York City is killed by a nearly impossible sniper shot. Unable to pinpoint where the shot came from, as the storm rapidly wipes out evidence, the agent-in-charge Brett Kehoe turns to the one man who might be able to help them--former FBI agent Lucas Page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Page, a university professor and bestselling author, left the FBI years ago after a tragic event robbed him of a leg, an arm, an eye, and the willingness to continue. But he has an amazing ability to read a crime scene, figure out angles and trajectories in his head, and he might be the only one to be able to find the sniper&#39;s nest. With a new wife and family, Lucas Page has no interest in helping the FBI--except for the fact that the victim was his former partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agreeing to help for his partner&#39;s sake, Page finds himself hunting a killer with an unknown agenda and amazing sniper skills in the worst of conditions. And his partner&#39;s murder is only the first in a series of meticulously planned murders carried out with all-but-impossible sniper shots. The only thing connecting the deaths is that the victims are all with law enforcement--that is until Page&#39;s own family becomes a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To identify and hunt down this ruthless, seemingly unstoppable killer, Page must discover what hidden past connects the victims before he himself loses all that is dear to him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
