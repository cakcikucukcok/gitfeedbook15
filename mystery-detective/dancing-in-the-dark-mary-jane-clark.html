  <title>Dancing in the Dark - Mary Jane Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mary Jane Clark turns up the heat in a drop-dead frightening novel about an idyllic beach community turned killer&#39;s hunting ground&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to mix business with pleasure, KEY News correspondent Diane Mayfield has brought her children and her sister to the New Jersey shore town of Ocean Grove to investigate a story on &quot;girls who cry wolf&quot; for the season premiere of &lt;i&gt;Hourglass,&lt;/i&gt; television&#39;s highly rated news magazine. Diane lands an exclusive interview with a troubled young woman whose tale of being abducted and held against her will for three terrifying days had been disbelieved by the authorities. No sooner does Diane finish taping the interview, though, than a second victim disappears. The small community, already in the grip of a record heat wave, is now wracked by fear and terror--no one knows who could be next. With only the first victim as eyewitness, Diane and the police turn to her for clues. But it may be too late to save Diane and her loved ones from the mortal danger that lurks in Ocean Grove. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of twists, turns, and terrifyingly real danger, &lt;i&gt;Dancing in the Dark&lt;/i&gt; is Mary Jane Clark&#39;s most suspenseful thriller yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
