  <title>Beach, Breeze, Bloodshed - John Keyse-Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Sun, Sand, Murder &lt;/i&gt;by John Keyse-Walker is a winner. It is written with the coral clarity of a Caribbean atoll, and evokes an edgy rhythm that suits the protagonist, Teddy Creque, and his wholly authentic domain, the Virgin Islands.&quot;--Randy Wayne White&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After barely surviving the first criminal investigation in living memory on the sun-drenched British Virgin island of Anegada, Constable Teddy Creque has spent the past six months trying to weather the aftermath, and move on with his life. Now, with a promotion and a medal of honor, he&#39;s newly committed to the job. So when a young  woman dies in a shark attack off the coast of a neighboring island, Virgin Gorda, Teddy is happy to help when Deputy Commissioner Howard Lane orders him to capture the man-eater. But when Teddy arrives on Virgin Gorda, he begins to suspect there was human foul play involved, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, the sharks around the idyllic island aren&#39;t known for attacking humans, and there are some oddities at the scene. Unfortunately, while Teddy is convinced that the woman&#39;s death wasn&#39;t accidental, not everyone on the island takes kindly to his meddling, and he&#39;s forced to be creative in his pursuit of justice. In unfamiliar territory, and with his sole witness a silent child who communicates in unorthodox ways, Teddy must earn the trust of the reserved residents of the touristy island, tangle with a loquacious parrot, and follow the clues which might lead him directly into the path of a killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Keyse-Walker, the winner of the 2015 Minotaur Books/Mystery Writers of America First Crime Novel Award, has written another taut, witty mystery that will keep readers mesmerized from the opening page to the stunning conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
