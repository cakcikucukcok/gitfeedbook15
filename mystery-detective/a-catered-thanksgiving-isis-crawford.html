Everything has to be perfect, or they risk getting cut out of dominating patriarch Monty&#39;s lucrative will. That&#39;s where sisters Bernie and Libby&#39;s catering company, A Little Taste of Heaven, comes in. Surely with their lumpless mashed potatoes and to-die-for gravy, even the super-dysfunctional Fields can get along for one meal. But no one can dress up disaster when the turkey goes boom right in Monty&#39;s scowling face, sending him to that great dining room in the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With everyone harboring their own cornucopia of secrets, discovering who wanted to carve up Monty won&#39;t be easy. Worse, the Field Mansion is draped under a snowstorm, trapping them with a killer determined to get more than his piece of the pie. Bernie and Libby will have to find out who the culprit is, fast, before the leftovers--and their chances of surviving--run out for good.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Spritely.  .  .
