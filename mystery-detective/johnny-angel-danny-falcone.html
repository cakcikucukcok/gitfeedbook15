  <title>Johnny Angel - Danny Falcone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What happens when a vicious mafia solider has an unshakable alliance with the three biggest crime syndicates?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Traveling the world ignites the spirit but navigating the cultural underworld of organized crime could steal your soul. From the ghettos in China to the international brotherhood of the Russian mafia and from the Colombian cartel to the crew who run the streets of Harlem, their crimes reach across the globe as the world witnesses their chilling trail of corruption, extortion, scams and murder. The catalyst to it all is Giovanni Bassemo aka Johnny Angel. Greed, deceit and betrayal at every turn threaten to break their strategic alliances. Their secret societies mix fear and violence with a manipulative genius rivaled only by their collective minds, resulting in higher and higher stakes. Their ruthless reaping of money, power and prestige destroys the lives of everyone who gets in their way.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;JOHNNY ANGEL is a raw, insider&#39;s look at the inner workings of the five biggest ethnic organized crime groups in the world. Boris Alekseyev aka The Fighter leads the Izmaylovskaya Gang (Russian Mafia). Meng Chang aka Lee is the leader of the Tongs (Chinese Mafia). Hector Lopez aka Yankee is the Colombian Cartel&#39;s main man in the USA. Mark Owens aka Apollo rules Harlem. Johnny Angel who women love and men fear is the traditional Italian Mafia captain and core connection to the other leaders. Their bonds from childhood are unshakable. Their ruthlessness is unparalleled. The plotting against Johnny shrouds him as the treachery thickens. The calmness of his response comes full circle in the brilliant yet vengeful counter-attack as he turns the tables on all of his conspiring killers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Angel is one of a series of four.&lt;/p&gt;" />
