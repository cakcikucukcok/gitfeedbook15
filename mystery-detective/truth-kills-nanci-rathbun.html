  <title>Truth Kills - Nanci Rathbun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angelina Bonaparte is a woman on a mission: to find the truth.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;rsquo;s had enough of lies and deceit.&amp;nbsp; Her twenty-plus year marriage to Mr. Bozo (no, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t refer to him that way in front of their grown children or their grandchildren) is over, destroyed by his roving eye and pitiful excuses.&amp;nbsp; She sheds her housewife attitude and clothes for sexy designer duds and a kick-ass approach to her new career as a private investigator.&amp;nbsp; A 50-something hottie, Angie takes no prisoners in her quest for honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracie Belloni, hugely pregnant with her fourth child, hires Angie to scope out the charges for lingerie, perfume and furs on her husband&amp;rsquo;s Visa bill. &amp;nbsp;Anthony, a.k.a Tony Baloney, hasn&amp;rsquo;t brought a single goodie to Gracie.&amp;nbsp; No sooner does Angie uncover a liaison between Tony and gold-digger Elisa Morano, than Elisa&amp;rsquo;s body, shot and riddled with stab wounds, is discovered in the apartment building owned by Belloni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracie adopts a stand-by-your-man position and pleads with Angie to work with Tony&amp;rsquo;s lawyer, Bart Matthews, as part of the defense team.&amp;nbsp; Torn between contempt for Tony and compassion for Gracie and the kids, Angie decides to sign on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of the investigation, she confronts some of her own demons.&amp;nbsp; Her Sicilian-American family&amp;rsquo;s Mafia ties are exposed by the media.&amp;nbsp; She struggles to balance the pre-Friedan values of her upbringing as she makes her way in a post-feminist world.&amp;nbsp; The faith of her childhood is challenged by religious bigotry and hatred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Angie meets more than just her inner demons as she searches for the truth of Elisa&amp;rsquo;s death.&amp;nbsp; She also encounters Jane Dunwoodie, who manages her home, family, and the Dunwoodie Insurance Agency while her husband, John, just plays; Bobbie Russell, the dishy gay&amp;nbsp; man who took Elisa&amp;rsquo;s job at the Dunwoodie Insurance Agency and who guides Angie as the investigation moves into the homosexual subculture of Milwaukee; Elisa&amp;rsquo;s onetime friend and roommate, Marsha Cantwell, struggling to recover from Elisa&amp;rsquo;s betrayal; Mrs. Lembke, the acute observer and busybody, who lived across the street from Elisa and Marsha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Wukowski, the attractive, but oppositional Milwaukee police detective assigned to the Morano homicide.&amp;nbsp; (&amp;ldquo;Do they call you Wookie?&amp;rdquo; she asks him.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Only once,&amp;rdquo; he responds.)&amp;nbsp; Their relationship begins in confrontation and dislike, as Wukowski struggles with the emotional aftermath of the brutal torture and death of his former female MPD partner.&amp;nbsp; He sets off all of Angie&amp;rsquo;s warning bells from a marriage that shaped her into a woman she worked hard to reinvent after her divorce.&amp;nbsp; Despite their initial antagonism, they feel the tingles of physical attraction and begin to realize that they&amp;rsquo;re on the same team, searching for justice and truth in an unjust and untrue world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth Kills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;offers a strong set of characters: some searching for honesty in a dishonest world and some sure that they alone know the truth, all explored within the metropolitan, yet small town atmosphere of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
