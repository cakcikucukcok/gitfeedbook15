  <title>Luke Stone Thriller: Oath of Office (#2) and Situation Room (#3) - Jack Mars</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A bundle of books #2 (OATH OF OFFICE) and #3 (SITUATION ROOM) in Jack Mars&#39;s Luke Stone Thriller series-a bestseller with over 150 five star reviews! This bundle offers books one and two in one convenient file, with over 150,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OATH OF OFFICE, a biological agent is stolen from a biocontainment lab. Weaponized, it could kill millions, and a desperate national hunt ensues to catch the terrorists before it is too late. Luke Stone, head of an elite FBI department, with his own family still in jeopardy, has vowed to walk away-but when the new President, barely sworn in, calls him, he can&#39;t turn his back on her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SITUATION ROOM A cyberattack on an obscure U.S. dam leaves thousands dead and the government wondering who attacked it, and why. When they realize it is just the tip of the iceberg-and that the safety of all of America is at stake-the President has no choice but to call in Luke Stone. Head of an elite, disbanded FBI team, Luke does not want the job. But with new enemies-foreign and domestic-closing in on her from all sides, the President can only trust him. What follows is an action-packed international roller-coaster, as Luke learns that the terrorists are more sophisticated than anyone realizes, that the target is more extensive than anyone could image-and that there is very little time left to save America.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political thrillers with non-stop action, dramatic international settings, unexpected twists and heart-pounding suspense, the Luke Stone series is an explosive new series that will leave you turning pages late into the night. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #4 in the series will be available soon." />
