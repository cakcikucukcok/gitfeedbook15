  <title>Hog Wild - Cathy Pickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A runaway pig is about as explosive a piece of news as there is to be found in Dacus at the moment. But shortly after Avery Andrews has returned to her hometown, all hell breaks loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her new office is still in disorder when Maggy Avinger arrives, clutching a copy of her dead husband&#39;s letter to his lawyer. He&#39;s made arrangements for an enormous stone angel to be erected at his grave and for the angel&#39;s plaque to read that Maggy murdered him. His doctor says Harden died of lung cancer, so he&#39;s really got some nerve. Plus--and what really bothers Maggy--the garish angel is in such bad taste!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avery promises to look into it. In the meantime, Maggy invites her to a native plant rescue at the site of a new development. A dead body is found crammed into an abandoned mine hole and a series of gruesome deaths follow. Avery discovers that the victims had received anonymous letters accusing them of various ethical shortcomings. With the help of an attractive reporter who seems too good for her father&#39;s humble paper, Avery seeks to find a connection between the disasters and nab a killer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the third in a distinctly charming series that keeps getting stronger and funnier with every book. Pickens&#39;s voice is nothing short of delightful as she develops these characters, all the more endearing for their eccentricities. Whether moonpies are a staple of one&#39;s diet or not, readers will feel right at home. In the best of ways.&lt;/p&gt;" />
