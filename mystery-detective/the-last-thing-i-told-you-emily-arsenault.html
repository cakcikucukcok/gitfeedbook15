  <title>The Last Thing I Told You - Emily Arsenault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Evening Spider&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Broken Teaglass&lt;/em&gt; comes this psychological thriller about the murder of a psychologist in a quiet New England town and his former patient whose unreliable thread will keep readers guessing until the shocking end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hear myself whispering. &lt;/em&gt;Not again. Not again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did I ever come back here? Surely because of you. Because I thought of something I&amp;#8217;d always meant to tell you. Because you were the only one I ever really wanted to tell it to&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapist Dr. Mark Fabian is dead&amp;#8212;bludgeoned in his office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#8217;t stop former patient Nadine Raines from talking to him&amp;#8212;in her head. Why did she come back to her hometown after so many years away? Everyone here thinks she&amp;#8217;s crazy. And she has to admit&amp;#8212;they might have good reason to think so. She committed a shockingly violent act when she was sixteen, and has never really been able to explain that dark impulse&amp;#8212;even to Fabian. Now that Fabian&amp;#8217;s dead, why is she still trying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as Detective Henry Peacher investigates Fabian&amp;#8217;s death, he discovers that shortly before he died, Fabian pulled the files of two former patients. One was of Nadine Raines, one of Henry&amp;#8217;s former high school classmates. Henry still remembers the disturbing attack on a teacher that marked Nadine as a deeply troubled teen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More shockingly, the other file was of Johnny Streeter, who is now serving a life sentence for a mass shooting five years ago. The shooting devastated the town and everyone&amp;#8212;including Henry, who is uncomfortable with the &amp;#8220;hero&amp;#8221; status the tragedy afforded him&amp;#8212;is ready to move on. But the appearance of his file brings up new questions. Maybe there is a decades-old connection between Nadine and Streeter. And maybe that somehow explains what Nadine is doing in Fabian&amp;#8217;s office nearly twenty years after being his patient. Or how Fabian ended up dead two days after her return. Or why Nadine has fled town once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Nadine and Henry head toward a confrontation, both will discover that the secrets of people&amp;#8217;s hearts are rarely simple, and&amp;#8212;even in the hidden depths of a psychologist&amp;#8217;s files&amp;#8212;rarely as they appear.&lt;/p&gt;" />
