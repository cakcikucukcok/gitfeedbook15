  <title>DNA Never Lies - Kari Kilgore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Betty Falconen: the most overqualified low-rent geneticist in Atlanta.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overwhelmed by old insecurities and struggles to pay the rent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her dreams of cutting-edge research withering on life-support.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Betty wanted more from life and work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will a stranger in a coffee shop bring the change she craves?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or prove her fears right after all?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An excerpt from &lt;i&gt;DNA Never Lies&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;An offer too good to refuse, but at what cost?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One last surprise waited for Betty: an application to qualify as a contractor for the Baron County Police Department. Specifically, to re-examine evidence from recent crime scenes. A background check, a confidentiality agreement, and&amp;hellip;an offer of payment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wow,&amp;rdquo; Betty whispered, shaking her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Payment equal to what she&amp;rsquo;d earned over the last six months of work her lab assistants could do in their sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turning Detective Willa Belladeux down cold didn&amp;rsquo;t seem nearly as easy as it had the night before, but not because of the money.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, not only because of the money.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The feeling of being in demand, of being appreciated, carried a lot more weight and influence. The idea of getting to work in the field she&amp;rsquo;d wanted. Yes, what she&amp;rsquo;d trained for. What her talents and skills were best suited for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of that together got Betty up and dialing the number on the business card clipped to the application before she could change her mind." />
