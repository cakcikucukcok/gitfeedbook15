  <title>The Cordelia Squad - Mary Anne Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;When true love hits,&quot; he used to tell her---like he knew what he was talking about---&quot;you can almost hear it go click.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That was a laugh.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&#39;d cried for months, really. Cried when people came to look at the house. Cried at the closing. Cried at the lawyer&#39;s when she&#39;d filed for divorce. Cried, especially, when the children tried to be kind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well, it was over. She wasn&#39;t crying anymore.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divorce has left Claire Breslinsky with two teenagers and very little cash. So maybe it&#39;s rash of her to buy a huge and very dilapidated mansion in Queens. The plan, such as it is, is to somehow magically transform the place into a charming and profitable bed-and-breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fire at the Cordelia Inn, Claire&#39;s incipient hostel, brings fear of arson---and a firefighter with an eye for Claire. Then the wealthy contractor threatening Claire&#39;s business offers to rent Claire&#39;s best room. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Mary Anne Kelly&#39;s first book, &lt;i&gt;Park Lane South, Queens&lt;/i&gt;, the events in the life of the Breslinsky family have been followed by readers who feel they are sitting in Mary Breslinsky&#39;s kitchen. The author&#39;s gift for breathing genuine life into her characters is on brilliant display in &lt;i&gt;The Cordelia Squad---&lt;/i&gt;a stirring portrait of Irish-Polish fortitude.&lt;/p&gt;" />
