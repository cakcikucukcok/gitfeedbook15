  <title>Honestly Dearest, You&#39;re Dead - Jack Fredrickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Safe Place for Dying&lt;/i&gt;, the first in Jack Fredrickson&#39;s highly acclaimed Dek Elstrom mystery series, was nominated for the Shamus Award for Best First Novel. Now, Chicago P.I. Dek Elstrom is back in an electrifying new mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer calls Dek with a fast, seven-hundred dollar proposition. A dead client named Dek to execute her will. No matter that Dek didn&#39;t know the woman. No matter, too, that the woman&#39;s estate was only worth a few hundred. Happens all the time, the lawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Dek Elstrom, broke and huddling in a cold stone turret in the middle of February, the sound of seven hundred falling down his chimney is louder than his voice of reason. He agrees, heads up to a hamlet ten miles north of nowhere. But instead of finding an easy-to-close estate, he finds blood and the markers of a shattered life. And something worse: links to the darkest part of his own past. He races to chase down leads to the killer, and his own ghost...before the dead woman is killed again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
