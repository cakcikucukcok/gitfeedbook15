  <title>&#39;&#39;Dead Low&#39;&#39; - Corbett A. Davis Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the first time since Powell Taylor and Dawn Landry hit town in the Florida Keys, they were both beginning to question their once hot love affair. After a meaningless argument that neither would later remember, Dawn suddenly disappeared from a Key West hospital.
&quot;Dead Low&quot; is the story of a love sick jeweler, motivated by that love and guilt, searching for the girl ofhis dreams. When mutilated bodies begin to show up in the Florida Straights around the lower Keys, Powell begins to expect a connection to Dawn&#39;s disappearance.
Once his fears are confirmed, time is quickly running out for Dawn&#39;s survival. With the help ofhis friend Captain Limbo, the two embark on a treacherous journey that eventually leads them across the Gulf Stream into Cuba. 
It is not until their cursed encounter with the crew of an antiquated rusty hulled ship docked in Havana that Dawn&#39;s fate is fully revealed." />
