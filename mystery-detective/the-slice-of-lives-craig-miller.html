His cutting edge educational system is innovatively changing the scholastic culture of how we shape young minds. His family life includes helping an elderly woman look after two young men that have a neurodevelopmental disorder. He is a credit to society. With the exception of being a serial killer.

Calvin understands that he is living on borrowed time as he tries to understand and cope with his internal torture. This story will grip you by the throat and not let go. An unspoiled blend of humor, love and murder all perfectly pointing the reader towards the bewilderment of life." />
