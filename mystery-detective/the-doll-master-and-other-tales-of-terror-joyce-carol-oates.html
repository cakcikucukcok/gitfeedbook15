  <title>The Doll-Master and Other Tales of Terror - Joyce Carol Oates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From one of our most important contemporary writers, &lt;I&gt;The Doll-Master and Other Tales of Terror&lt;/I&gt; is a bold, haunting collection of six stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the title story, a young boy becomes obsessed with his cousin&amp;#8217;s doll after she tragically passes away from leukemia. As he grows older, he begins to collect &amp;#147;found dolls&amp;#8221; from the surrounding neighborhoods and stores his treasures in the abandoned carriage house on his family&#39;s estate. But just what kind of dolls are they? In &amp;#147;Gun Accident,&amp;#8221; a teenage girl is thrilled when her favorite teacher asks her to house-sit, even on short notice. But when an intruder forces his way into the house while the girl is there, the fate of more than one life is changed forever. In &amp;#147;Equatorial,&amp;#8221; set in the exotic Galapagos, an affluent American wife experiences disorienting assaults upon her sense of who her charismatic husband really is, and what his plans may be for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Doll-Master and Other Tales of Terror&lt;/I&gt;, Joyce Carol Oates evokes the &amp;#147;fascination of the abomination&amp;#8221; that is at the core of the most profound, the most unsettling, and the most memorable of dark mystery fiction.&lt;/div&gt;" />
