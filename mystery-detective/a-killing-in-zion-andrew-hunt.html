  <title>A Killing in Zion - Andrew Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the scorching, drought-plagued summer of 1934, as wildfires burn across Utah, Detective Lieutenant Art Oveson faces a unique assignment. Salt Lake City&#39;s mayor has tapped him to revive the Anti-Polygamy Squad, a unit formed years earlier for the purpose of driving out the city&#39;s &quot;plural marriage zealots.&quot; As a Mormon ashamed of his own ancestors&#39; part in the church&#39;s polygamist past, Art is eager to do his part to flush out the extremists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a local polygamist &quot;prophet&quot; is brutally murdered and a shell-shocked young girl is found at the scene of the crime. Is she the victim&#39;s daughter, a child bride, or the murderer herself? Art attempts to investigate the death, as well as discover her identity, despite a &quot;wall of silence&quot; put up by polygamists who would rather mete out their own rough justice. Soon, however, Art discovers that the sect has much more to hide than he thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historian and Hillerman Prize-winning author of &lt;i&gt;City of Saints &lt;/i&gt;Andrew Hunt returns to 1930s Salt Lake City in this deeply researched mystery.&lt;i&gt; A Killing in Zion&lt;/i&gt; portrays a city and a religion struggling to grow and shake off a notorious history that has not yet become a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
