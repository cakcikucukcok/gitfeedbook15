  <title>Stay At Home Dead - Jeffrey Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s a day like any other for Deuce Winters, a stay-at-home dad in sleepy Rose Petal, Texas, where he and his three-year-old daughter Carly are making their weekly trip to the grocery store. But the discovery of a dead body in his mini-van quickly throws his quiet life into disarray. In a town where gossip spreads faster than a brush fire in July, it doesn&#39;t help that the victim ruined Deuce&#39;s high school football career and married his ex-girlfriend.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the number one suspect in the court of public opinion, Deuce is determined to clear his name, with a little help from his wife Julianne, a high-powered attorney who lovingly refers to him as her &quot;househusband.&quot; His search for the killer leads him to a business plan gone awry and a gaggle of jilted lovers. All the while, he&#39;ll have to contend with a diminutive but feisty detective, the ruthless preschool PTA, and more than his fair share of Texas-sized hairdos--not to mention the laundry.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;First in a New Series! &lt;/b&gt;" />
