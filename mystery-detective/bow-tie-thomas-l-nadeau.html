  <title>Bow Tie - Thomas L. Nadeau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Former California political fi xer turned private investigator, Wyatt (a.k.a, Bow-Tie), receives a surprise visit from former flame, Lottie Renz. She pleads with Wyatt to help her out of a jam. The FBI is investigating major corruption in State government in which she was a minor bit player, and she fears she will be cast to the wolves to take major blame. Save me, Wyatt! she pleads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old emotions get the better of him, and Wyatt starts down the web of Lotties connections. They lead to prominent members of the State Assembly and Senate, and the FBI, as well as to shadowy heads of shell corporations. Eventually, the trail leads to possible homicide. Navigating a minefield of shifting and outright dangerous threats, Wyatt attempts to bring the world back into some semblance of his own notions of balance and justice. Written in the style of Roman-Noire by an author who actually worked the political scene, the story reveals behind-the-curtain glimpses of rough-and-tumble California politics that are rarely encountered by everyday citizens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an adventure! Nadeaus writing conveys mood and captures the reader &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;from the first page. BOW TIE is a memorable entry in the noire genre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Mary Blayney, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Bestselling Author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining his Maine-bred Yankee sensibilities with his first hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;knowledge and experience in bare-knuckles California politics, Nadeaus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bowtie tells a timeless tale of deception and corruption with a dash of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;humor that is especially relevant today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
