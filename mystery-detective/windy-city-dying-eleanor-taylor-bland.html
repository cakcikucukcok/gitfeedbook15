  <title>Windy City Dying - Eleanor Taylor Bland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marti MacAlister, Eleanor Taylor Bland&#39;s popular African-American heroine, is forced to confront some extremely personal demons from long ago-her husband Johnny MacAlister is long-buried, but now someone from Johnny&#39;s past is back, looking for him, and Marti fears she knows who it might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, her work as a suburban Chicago homicide detective has taken her back in time in another way, to a group of children she once counseled, each now four years older and with four more year&#39;s worth of problems. There&#39;s LaShawna, now seventeen and with her own four-year-old daughter; Padgett, all grown up at twelve but still living with his alcoholic mother; and then Jose, fifteen, who&#39;s in the most trouble of them all. He&#39;s been accused of murder, but the Jose that Marti remembers could not have committed such a terrible crime. Her first step is to find out what could have happened in the past four years to lead Jose to such a desperate act, and she hopes her second step will be to prove his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won&#39;t be easy, though; just what&#39;s going on with this tight group of kids, and how does it relate to the increasingly foreboding sense of doom Marti gets about the mystery man who&#39;s nosing around the remnants of her distant past? She&#39;s not sure, but she knows she must figure it all out, and soon, before another of the children, or even Marti herself, falls into grave danger. &lt;i&gt;Windy City Dying&lt;/i&gt; is another taut, absorbing read from one of the masters of mystery fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
