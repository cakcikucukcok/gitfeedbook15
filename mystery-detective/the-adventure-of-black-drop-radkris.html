  <title>The Adventure of Black Drop - Radkris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A gunshot leaves a dead man in an East End alley. A beautiful woman lies dead on the lawns of Windsor Castle. The only certain aspect of a beadles death is its precipitation by gravity. A mere bump into a gentleman sends an old man to his death amidst Piccadillys evening throngs. Did the gunshot echo through time and claim the three other souls or had their time simply run out? One mans calibre matches these crimes. 
A mathematicians ingenious deviance compounds Londons smog as he surpasses his past transgressions and discovers the means to control the future. But his plan is plagued by one man brave enough to play in the web in his criminal parlour. 
Coerced to alter his modus operandi, this man works on more than one case simultaneously, navigating smoke and mirrors, while trying to earn back a trusted friend, trusting reluctantly in a mysterious Indian and evading death at every corner of London. 
Can this man emerge a victor in a fight to save something as whimsical as the future of the world? 
But above all else, will he emerge alive  body, mind and soul? 
Who is this man? He is 
Sherlock Holmes!" />
