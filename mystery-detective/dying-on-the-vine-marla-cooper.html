  <title>Dying on the Vine - Marla Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When wedding planner Kelsey McKenna goes to the Wine Country Wedding Faire, the last thing she expects to do is take on new clients. After all, she&#39;s just there to help out her friend Brody and maybe score some free cupcakes. But when a young couple in a pinch asks for her help, she just can&#39;t say no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s only one problem: they&#39;d been working with Babs Norton, the self-proclaimed Queen of Wine Country Weddings--and things did not end well. Kelsey wants to make sure there are no hard feelings, but unfortunately she never gets the chance. When she goes to Babs&#39; office, she finds the wedding planner dead on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babs&#39; high-strung assistant Stefan knows exactly who killed Babs: Kelsey. At least, that&#39;s what he very publicly accuses her of at Babs&#39; funeral. When Kelsey decides to do a little sleuthing to clear her name, she uncovers a myriad of secrets and lies. And when a second wedding planner is attacked, Kelsey begins to wonder if she might be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the stunning backdrop of California wine country, Marla Cooper&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Dying on the Vine&lt;/i&gt; is a mystery brimming with gossip, wine, and, of course...murder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
