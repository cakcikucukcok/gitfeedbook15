  <title>The Super-Devil - Carroll John Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The mean streets have never been so divided, nor so willing, to pay Race Williams for his services. So when private investigators start turning up dead in Coburn, and a dirty gangster warns him not to go, Williams is only too curious to find out what&amp;rsquo;s amuck in the city. Yet, Race Williams doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for free, and his services follow the highest bidder. With two warring sides willing to offer him any amount for a job, Williams must walk a thin line to avoid upsetting the wrong man and keep his head on a swivel to avoid being the next to get taken out. Story #14 in the Race Williams series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carroll John Daly (1889&amp;ndash;1958) was the creator of the first hard-boiled private eye story, predating Dashiell Hammett&amp;#39;s first Continental Op story by several months. Daly&amp;#39;s classic character, Race Williams, was one of the most popular fiction characters of the pulps, and the direct inspiration for Mickey Spillane&amp;#39;s Mike Hammer." />
