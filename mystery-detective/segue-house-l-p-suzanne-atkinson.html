You will also meet Shelia Pasco, the overnight security guard, distant and antisocial while longing to be loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segue House is a shelter for women and children seeking escape from violence and abuse. Segue House also serves as sanctuary for the connecting force that ultimately threatens to undermine the safety and security that has become so important in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segue House Connection examines the unintended consequences of behaviours when lives intersect by chance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
