  <title>The Cracked Spine - Paige Shelton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanted:&lt;/b&gt;  A bold adventurer who wants to travel the world from a comfortable and  safe spot behind a desk that has seen the likes of kings and queens,  paupers and princes. A humble book and rare manuscript shop seeks a  keenly intelligent investigator to assist us in our search for things  thought lost, and in our quest to return lost items to their rightful  owners. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Never an adventurer, no one was more surprised than  Delaney Nichols when she packed her bags and moved halfway across the  world to Edinburgh, Scotland to start a job at The Cracked Spine, a  bookshop located in the heart of the city. Her new boss, Edwin  MacAlister, has given her the opportunity of a lifetime, albeit a  cryptic one, and Delaney can&#39;t wait to take her spot behind the desk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  Cracked Spine is filled with everything a book lover could want, each  item as eclectic as the people who work there; the spirited and lovable  Rosie, who always has tiny dog Hector in tow; Hamlet, a  nineteen-year-old thespian with a colored past and bright future; and  Edwin, who is just as enigmatic and mysterious as Delaney expected. An  extra bonus is Tom the bartender from across the street, with his cobalt  eyes, and a gentle brogue--and it doesn&#39;t hurt that he looks awfully  good in a kilt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before she can settle into her new life, a  precious artifact goes missing, and Edwin&#39;s sister is brutally murdered.  Never did Delaney think that searching for things lost could mean a  killer, but if she&#39;s to keep her job, and protect her new friends,  she&#39;ll need to learn the truth behind this Scottish tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
