  <title>The Producer&#39;s Girl - Complicated! Seductive! Magical! - Michael C. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bobbi Stratos PI is everyone’s go-to girl now facing burnout. What she needs is a holiday. What she gets is to be thrown blind into a deadly movieland multiple homicide case with a bully film producer and all his baggage, an individualistic Boston cop obsessed with a little girl’s murder, a sadistic hit man whose specialty is knife work, and a body count that just keeps rising. 
Trouble begins when Lou Lazar, neurotic Hollywood studio boss at Bugatti Films, sends Bobbi to Boston at big bucks to sort out a growing mess there when one of his line producers shows up dead. Bobbi walks off the plane and straight into Connell&#39;s life. Can they work together in time to bring down a secretive crime group and their sadistic blade-loving killer?
Det. Ty Connell is a hybrid character based on police officers Michael Hughes has known personally, at the city, state, and federal levels. He also counts as an invaluable research source a formerly active member of one of New York City&#39;s major crime families, now retired." />
