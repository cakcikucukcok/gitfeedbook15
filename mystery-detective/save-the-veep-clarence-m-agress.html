A young boy with the same rare blood type is also on life-support. Priority is decided by the National organization, UNOS, policy: organ transplant to the recipient with the best life-expectancy. But the President has designated that the first heart is to go to the Veep. Complicating the situation a Mexican running a fattening house , an organ trafficking horror, which takes organs from live Victims, has offered a heart for the surgeons nephew, the boy, out of gratitude for saving his life. It is amoral and illegal to accept. 
Further complicating the story, a Saudi Prince, fearful that a decision to accept the oil from the pipe-line will end the dependence of the US on OPEC, sends an assassin to kill the Veep." />
