  <title>Murder in the Maze - Lloyd Biggle Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the first place, Grandfather Rastin never should have bought that house in Wiston. It happened several years ago, when he was only about seventy-eight, but even so he was old enough to know better. He admits that himself.
&lt;P&gt;
In the second place, he should have asked his tenants for references.

He did buy the house, and he didn&#39;t ask for references, and that&#39;s where the trouble started...

Lloyd Biggle, Jr. (1923-2002) is most famous as a science-fiction writer who used genuine science while emphasizing human and cultural elements, especially art and music (he held a Ph.D. in Musicology.) His detective stories about Grandfather Bill Rastin in the fictitious Borg County, Michigan show this emphasis on the human element in a nostalgic, Norman Rockwell-esque world." />
