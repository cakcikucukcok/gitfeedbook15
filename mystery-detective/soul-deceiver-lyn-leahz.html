  <title>Soul Deceiver - Lyn Leahz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Unified High Priest, Khalid al-Kabul and his UNIFY church gain worldwide acclaim and draw millions to their ranks, Christians fear the emergence of a one-world religion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krista Coblentz teams with Detective Darnell Simpson, a backslidden Christian, after police discover Kristas best friend savagely murdered and dismembered. Kristas relationship with Simpson disintegrates after she accepts an invitation to one of Khalids demonic services promoting his perfect one-world church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Tennessee, retired Pentecostal minister Walter Caldwell hears from God that its time to take the message of repentance to the streets, and God wants Caldwell to lead the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could UNIFY truly be the apostasy and the emergence of a one-world religion foretold in the Bible Christians believe it ismerely a counterfeit forged by Satan himself that shall lead even the elect astray? Or could it be the perfect church the Bible predicts, rising up out of the darkness, delivering a new world peace by fusing Christians and Muslims together as one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Leahz masterfully weaves this end-times thriller with excitement, murder, intrigue, romance and mystery. This fast-paced prophetic classic will leave you breathless and eagerly awaiting the second book in Ms. Leahzs trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Endorsements:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What most Christians forget is that the main purpose of Gods plan for us is to fight and expose evil. Lyn Leahz in her fiction Soul Deceiver writes an amazing tale and embeds the necessary biblical truth to help us see the quagmire of delusion, deception and apostasy that engulf the church today. The gripping story sifts out the words of a sweet-talking devil that wants to unify Christianity with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Islam&quot; href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/topics/islam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; attempting to seduce us with flattery. The story tells how the prudent spirit-filled Christian can stand firm against the works of darkness. And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do [exploits]. (Dan 11:32)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Walid Shoebat, International Speaker and Best Selling Author of Gods War on Terror: Islam, Prophecy and the Bible.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;Walid Shoebat Foundation&quot; href=&quot;http://shoebat.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shoebat Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lyn Leahz is a gifted and brilliant author. This fictional thriller is truly a page-turner that will enthrall you from the first to the last word. A highly recommended read!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Joel Richardson, Best Selling Author of Islamic Antichrist and Mideast Beast.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;Joel Richardson&#39;s Homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.joelstrumpet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joels Trumpet Online &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;All one needs to do is watch the daily news, or read a newspaper, and compare those words to the Books of Daniel, Ezekiel, or Revelation, to understand the times in which we live. Lyn Leahz does a great job in her book, Soul Deceiver, pulling you into the lives of her characters, to allow you to experience the scenarios of end time prophecy. If you are a lover of end times eschatology, then Soul Deceiver is a must read. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim R. Philley, Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Operations Officer, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;SOURCE&quot; href=&quot;http://lynleahz.com/www.oru.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It is with great pleasure I recommend Soul Deceiver. Lyn Leahz is a gifted writer, and a remarkable Christian. Through much prayer and creativity, she has written a captivating and timely book about the end times. You will not be disappointed with this page-turner, guaranteed to keep you absorbed for hours! A must read!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Juliana Worsham, Author, A Joyful Life Made Simple. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Simply Juiliana&quot; href=&quot;http://simplyjuliana.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SimplyJuliana.co&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Soul Deceiver is a well-written, mind-captivating read. This edgy fictional work keeps you enthralled in events that could be taken right out of todays news. Lyn Leahz stays true to Gods Word while reminding us of our calling as disciples of Christ. Our primary objective, especially during the end times, is to keep Gods Word pure and to proclaim the Word of God as true without compromise. Lyn skillfully weaves these job requirements into a fast-paced exciting read that I highly recommend! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greg Holt,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;Inspirational Chrisitan Blogs&quot; href=&quot;http://inspirationalchristiansfortoday.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inspirational Christian Blogs&lt;/a&gt;
