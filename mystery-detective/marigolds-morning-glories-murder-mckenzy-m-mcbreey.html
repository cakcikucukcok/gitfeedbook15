  <title>Marigolds...Morning Glories...Murder - McKenzy M. McBreey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Mountain Valley Garden Club! First line of business: find out why one of the garden clubs members is murdered at the first garden club meeting of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain Valley is a quiet, horse friendly community, with hitching posts throughout the town, and colorful flowers woven in the towns countryside surroundings. One can stop at The Big Bean for a steaming cup of coffee, and swap gardening tips with a neighbor. One may even be sipping a latte, unknowingly chatting with a murderer, or sharing a muffin with the woman who makes it a habit of having affairs with other womens husbands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good looking new police chief in town, and his first major case is to find a killer. Former police chief, Brice Johansson, has shared his suspicions with the new chief, which might be helpful in solving the homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, Candace Hatcher, the town divorcee, is looking for a new husband. Can she perchance be dating the murderer? Is it even conceivable the murderer is one of the towns prominent senior citizens? Who knows what dark secrets lurk in the small town of Mountain Valley? &lt;/p&gt;" />
