  <title>16th Seduction - James Patterson, Maxine Paetro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Still recovering from her husband&#39;s betrayal, Detective Lindsay Boxer faces a series of heart-stopping crimes and a deadly conspiracy that threatens to destroy San Francisco.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fifteen months ago, Detective Lindsay Boxer&#39;s life was perfect. She had a beautiful child and a doting husband, Joe, who helped her catch a criminal who&#39;d brazenly detonated a bomb in downtown San Francisco, killing twenty-five people. But Joe wasn&#39;t everything that Lindsay thought he was, and she&#39;s still reeling from his betrayal as a wave of mysterious and possibly unnatural heart attacks claims seemingly unrelated victims across San Francisco.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As if that weren&#39;t enough, the bomber she and Joe captured is about to go on trial, and his defense raises damning questions about Lindsay and Joe&#39;s investigation. Not knowing whom to trust, and struggling to accept the truth about the man she thought she knew, Lindsay must connect the dots of a deadly conspiracy before a brilliant criminal puts &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; on trial.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Filled with the suspense and emotion that have made James Patterson the world&#39;s #1 bestselling writer, &lt;i&gt;16th Seduction&lt;/i&gt; is the Women&#39;s Murder Club&#39;s toughest case yet-and an exhilarating thrill ride from start to finish.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
