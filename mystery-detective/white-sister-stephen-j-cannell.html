  <title>White Sister - Stephen J. Cannell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ONE IS his beloved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving L.A.&#39;s Parker Center, Shane Scully and his wife, Alexa, agree to meet at home...but Alexa never arrives. Then Shane&#39;s called to a crime scene on Mulholland Drive, where the victim, an apparent gang member, has been executed--and left in Alexa&#39;s car. Her gun is the likely murder weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE OTHER Is his Nemesis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Shane desperately tries to find Alexa, his leads point to a feud between two gangsta-rap record companies, both heavily manned by Crips and Bloods. At the center of this war is a ruthless, beautiful Lady Macbeth-like white woman raised in Compton. Married to a multi-millionaire rap mogul, she is known as the White Sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&#39;s his worst nightmare come true...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shane is no stranger to big trouble, but he&#39;s never before been smeared as a &quot;racist cop&quot; or thrown in jail while there&#39;s a hit out on him. Much worse is the unknown fate of Alexa, and the fact that in the mysterious White Sister--who holds the clue to a sinister conspiracy--he may have met his match.&lt;/p&gt;" />
