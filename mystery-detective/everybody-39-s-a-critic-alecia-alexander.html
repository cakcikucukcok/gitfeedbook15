      <meta name="description" content="Denise Shelby, host of the popular Red Herring Channel show, &lt;I&gt;SHERLOCK AND COMPANY&lt;/I&gt;, has a problem. Charles Jessup, New York critic, has cancelled out on her third season premiere and she has less than three hours to find a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do? Enter James Prescott, author of the biography of the late and not particularly lamented media mogul, Maxwell &quot;Mad Max&quot; Winston. Winston&#39;s life was filled with blackmail, jilted lovers, libel suits, and mysterious death. Just the ticket for a show dedicated to mysteries right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. Winston died in 1980 so there are still plenty of people around who have long memories and big grudges, not to mention personal agendas. Yes, there are many people who would have preferred James not write his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Denise and James are about to find out, &lt;I&gt;EVERYBODY&#39;S A CRITIC&lt;/I&gt;." />
