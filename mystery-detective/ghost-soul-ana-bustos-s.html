  <title>Ghost Soul - Ana Bustos S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story begins with a normal 16 year-old girl (Sarah Anderson) who lives in Provo, Utah. She has good grades, her parents and teachers love her, and she is a jealous and a selfish girl. One day everything seemed to change when suddenly everyone start to treat her strangely and blame her for doing bad stuff. She figured out she had a strange rhombus mark in her chest. While she is in school, her friends are angry at her so she is alone. Until the most shy and mysterious guy (James Carter) in school decides to make her company. As time passes they form a very strong bond between each other. Sarah later figures out that James aunt doesnt want her near her nephew, but she doesnt listens. Later in the story they find out why everybody was blaming her for doing bad stuff. She was being controlled by a ghost (Sabina) from the Middle Ages who wanted to search for Allans reincarnation to get revenge. The rhombus in her chest was a portal to her soul and ghosts could cross it. Things change when they figure out that Allans reincarnation is James. Their goal is to defeat Sabina and stay together until the end." />
