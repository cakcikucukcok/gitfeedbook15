  <title>Do You Hear What I Hear - jusTemple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ring tone of insanity within sanity, the game of this trick is it wrong or right. The trick is the wo-man in the mirror, a reflection that has a sight for sore eyes.
The source of seeing with a match of light to influence the hearing, to take heeds to the shakes, rattles and rolls.
Remember my motto, exaggeration of the truth and a lie.
Welcome to Do you hear what I hear, the second of the trilogy, which brews within my mind. The captivation of many thoughts put in a picture of hearing in its devastating ring.
Seeing is the evidence of fantasizing within view but what is sound brewing.
The classifications of a horror, the program of statements to fling open the door to chapters of suspense. The words of expression to a system, to read with a boost in thought. The recalculation of a formula stirring within the syllables, forming a solution to handling the rejuvenation of panic, to make it secondary placement in this spin.
To the adjustment of paying attention to the hints for an enlighten ending.
Hint; a servant to all
With a see you later, one more is yet to come. Finalizing, 3 is a charm." />
