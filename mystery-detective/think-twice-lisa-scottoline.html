  <title>Think Twice - Lisa Scottoline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;From the blockbuster &lt;/I&gt;New York Times &lt;I&gt;bestselling author of &lt;/I&gt;Look Again &lt;I&gt;comes a novel that makes you question the nature of evil: is it born in us or is it bred? &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bennie Rosato looks exactly like her identical twin, Alice Connolly, but the darkness in Alice&#39;s soul makes them two very different women. Or at least that&#39;s what Bennie believes, until she finds herself buried alive at the hands of her twin. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Alice takes over Bennie&#39;s life, impersonating her at work and even seducing her boyfriend in order to escape the deadly mess she has made of her own life. But Alice underestimates Bennie and the evil she has unleashed in her twin&#39;s psyche, as well as Bennie&#39;s determination to stay alive long enough to exact revenge. &lt;br&gt;Bennie must face the twisted truth that she is more like her sister Alice than she could have ever imagined, and by the novel&#39;s shocking conclusion, Bennie finds herself engaged in a war she cannot win--with herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
