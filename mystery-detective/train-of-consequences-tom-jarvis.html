      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Entertaining and heartfelt  thoughtful and empathetic  well worth a read.&quot;
Kirkus Reviews
It is early 1991, and Shelton Cole has just turned thirteen. Barely surviving the aftermath of a car accident that has killed not only his brother but also his parents marriage, Shelton is thrilled when he becomes instant chums with Richie Kemp, a transplant from New York who has moved to New Hampshire with his mother to escape the stigma of his fathers imprisonment. But after Richies mother marries a man who revels in abusing Richie, the two troubled teenagers decide to embark on a journey that will change their lives forever.
As the two boys begin a life on the run, an old drifter takes them under his wing and introduces Shelton and Richie to an underground society of vagabonds, opening the boys eyes to a strange new world and unwittingly setting the course to a horrific chain of events that soon spiral out of control. 
Seventeen years later, Shelton returns to New Hampshire to fulfill a childhood promise to Richie. As he is flooded with buried memories, Shelton must face the demons of his tragic past before he can move forward.
Train of Consequences is a captivating thriller that highlights an unforgettable coming-of-age journey of friendship, misconceptions, and discovery." />
