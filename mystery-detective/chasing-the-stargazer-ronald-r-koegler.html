&lt;p&gt;What he doesnt know is that the stargazer he arrested so long ago is waiting for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon Don is swept up in a criminal world he does not understand. Complicating the situation is his infatuation with Laura, an old flame. In desperation, he turns to a man he has deliberately avoided for yearsBenito Desimone, his wifes uncle and a leader of the Philadelphia Mafia.&lt;/p&gt;
