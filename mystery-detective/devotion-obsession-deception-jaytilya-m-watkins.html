Stephen becomes obsessed over her and sets up a plot with one of Haras roommates to break her and Bishop up. When the plot doesnt go as planned, he kidnaps Hara and keeps her tied up in his barn for three weeks. Within those three weeks, he makes her quit TSU, turns her back to her friends and family, including Bishop. Also within those three weeks he beats and rapes her. Her mom hires a private investigator to find Hara. Once he finds Hara, her mom, the private investigator, and Bishop team up to rescue Hara, but the plan to rescue Hara will become a difficult task because Stephen has killed someone before and to keep Hara, he would do so again.&lt;/p&gt;
