  <title>Dear Boss - Kevin Marks, Thomas Mead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRYING TO PROVE&lt;/b&gt; that a historical figure was not Jack &lt;BR&gt;
The Ripper was the beginning of 15 years of research. At each &lt;BR&gt;
turn, whether it be motive, opportunity, psychological profile, &lt;BR&gt;
etc., I could not remove him from suspicion. What I found &lt;BR&gt;
only kept pointing more and more toward he could have &lt;BR&gt;
done it. It was painful not be able to cross him off my list. &lt;BR&gt;
As we have learned mass-murderers come in various shapes &lt;BR&gt;
and sizes. Theodore Robert Bundy by all appearances was a &lt;BR&gt;
well groomed, well-mannered model of young manhood and &lt;BR&gt;
yet underneath that facade lurked the cold heart of a killing &lt;BR&gt;
machine. My suspect does not fit that mold on the outside &lt;BR&gt;
but was thought to possess a spiritual soul and kind heart. &lt;BR&gt;
Could he have also hidden a dark side? A dark and hideous &lt;BR&gt;
side that could also patiently wait? Wait to grow strong and &lt;BR&gt;
lash out at the progenitors of his deep and repressed hatred? &lt;BR&gt;
Who of us can be sure we can spot a true monster? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;" />
