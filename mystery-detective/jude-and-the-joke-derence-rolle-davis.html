  <title>Jude and the Joke - Derence Rolle Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The town of St. Phillips is known for its peaceful ways-until the night Danielle McKenzie suddenly hears a scream and a splash in the river. After she investigates and finds nothing, she returns home without any idea that a chain of events has just unfolded that will change everything. Paul Metulas is determined to find money for more beer and drugs. It is not long before his mission leads him to a young man hitchhiking on the side of the road. After an unsuccessful robbery attempt, he pushes Jude Richie over the side of the Burke Bridge and leaves him to swim his way to the shore. But when Richie&#39;s body is discovered the next morning, the investigation eventually leads to the arrest of Metulas and four others. As their murder trial begins, the result is shrouded in mystery, leaving everyone to wonder if it was all just a joke. In this gripping mystery, an entire town becomes immersed in a trial where secrets are unraveled and drama comes to life after an innocent man is murdered." />
