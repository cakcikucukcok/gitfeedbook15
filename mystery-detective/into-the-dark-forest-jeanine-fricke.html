  <title>Into the Dark Forest - Jeanine Fricke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Olivia Clayton, a work-from-home book editor, and Alyssa Walton, a forest ranger in western Montana, have been best friends their entire lives. As close as sisters, the two have shared all their life experiences, including birthdays. This year, as they celebrate Alyssas, a black Humvee runs her down, and she is left to fight for her life in a comatose state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Crushed by grief, Olivia tries to figure out who would want to kill Alyssa and why. She remembers conversations she had with Alyssa before the attempt on her friends life. Taking clues from their talks, she enlists the help of Detective Sheldon and figures out that Alyssas brush with death is the result of a chance meeting in the forest nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As local man Joe Little Hawk comes under suspicion, Olivia fights her growing romantic feelings for Sheldon. Meanwhile, an attempt is made on Alyssas life at the hospital, thwarted by Olivia who now becomes a target, as well. A final standoff is coming in the deep, dark forest of Montana, and theres a good chance someone is going to end up dead. &lt;/p&gt;" />
