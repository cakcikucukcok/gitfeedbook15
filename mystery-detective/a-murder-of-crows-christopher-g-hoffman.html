  <title>A Murder of Crows - Christopher G Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; In 1945, at the end of World War 2, Joseph Stalin did not believe that Adolf Hitler would remain in his bunker and take his own life. &amp;nbsp;Figuring the German Fuhrer was too cocky, egotistical, and narcissistic, it must be a rouse giving him time to escape Berlin. With no confirmable facts provided to the public, Stalin unleashes Mikael his &amp;ldquo;Fixer&amp;rdquo; to hunt down and kill a list of escaped, high ranking, dangerous Nazis and their leader.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several years and little luck, the trail was getting cold. &amp;nbsp;Mikael makes a bold move and trades in his team of soldiers for a handpicked band of misfits, each with their own specialty and need for redemption. &amp;nbsp;Can this rag tag eccentric group do better than the elite forces that were previously sent on this mission? They will need to, if they intend on changing the course of history as we know it. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;No longer wanting to be a bystander to history, Professor Henry Fairchild joins the team. He leaves his remarkable findings in secret journals hidden and written in code, specifically for his brilliant granddaughter to decipher. She alone will decide what to do with the shocking information. What she uncovers brings an old evil to her small English town, and now her family is in danger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A Murder of Crows was originally written as a pay television series. The long awaited conversion to novel format has finally arrived. &amp;nbsp;Be sure to check out other books in the Fairchild Mystery-Thriller series where the author blends real life facts with his fictional team. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
