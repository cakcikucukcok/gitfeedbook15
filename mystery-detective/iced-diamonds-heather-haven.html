  <title>Iced Diamonds - Heather Haven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In late December, 1942, Persephone (Percy) Cole, one of Manhattan&amp;#39;s first female PIs, has been hired to find out who killed a Santa Land elf and left the body in the storefront window of a swank 5th Avenue jewelry store. Was it the spoiled heiress whose big buck handbag was found on the scene? Or was it the rat who broke out of the big house to settle a score? Shortly after, the corpse of the Christmas Angel is discovered stuffed in Mrs. Santa&amp;#39;s workshop. Will Santa Claus be next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a penchant for Marlene Dietrich suits, pistachio nuts and fedora hats, a 5&amp;rsquo;11&amp;rdquo; full-figured gal finds diamonds to the left of her, diamonds to the right, and skullduggery aplenty. As other vintage gumshoes of her era - Sam Spade, Lew Archer, and Phillip Marlowe - this shamus has a hard-boiled, take-no-prisoners attitude, but with a difference. She has a wicked sense of humor and is the mother of an eight-year old son. Blazing a trail for all other lady dicks to follow, Percy Cole is determined to solve these crimes or else it just might be the &amp;#39;kiss off&amp;#39; for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
