  <title>Assault on America - Michael S. Pendergast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Al-Qaeda and its allies scored two magnificent victories.  The first when they took down the WTC towers in New York and the second when they suckered the US into a war in Iraq.  Unfortunately for them, the US went from dismay and shock to shock and awe, beating the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and then Sadam Hussein into the ground in record time.  Now the survivors need a way to seize victory from the jaws of defeat  and an evil mastermind in Iran is sure he has found the way to do so.  
Suddenly one morning as America wakes, it finds rural hamlets and small towns have been ravaged during the night and hundreds murdered in their own homes. All by terrorists who have disappeared into the shadows before sunrise.
Is there any hope to stop this assault?  Of course there is, for there is always FBI special agent Philip Calvert, who is easily bored and quite unable to handle the most routine assignments.  When it comes to high-pressure crises where everything is on the line, however, he is unique.  And now he and an ad hoc team of agents, cops, and Marine sharpshooters he puts together are on the job." />
