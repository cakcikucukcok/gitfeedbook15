Box&#39;s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Badlands&lt;/i&gt;, the town of Grimstad used to be a place people came from but were never headed to. Now it&#39;s the oil capital of North Dakota. With oil comes money, with money comes drugs, and with drugs come the dirtiest criminals Grimstad&#39;s new deputy sheriff Cassie Dewell has ever encountered. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Kyle Westergaard dreams of getting out of Grimstad and leading a better life. Even though Kyle has been written off as a &quot;slow&quot; kid, he has dreams deeper than anyone can imagine. One day, while delivering newspapers, he witnesses a car accident and takes a mysterious bundle from the scene. Suddenly he&#39;s in possession of a lot of money--and packets of white powder--and Kyle can&#39;t help but wonder whether his luck has changed...for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Suspenseful--you can&#39;t put it down.&#39;&#39;--&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the temperature drops to 30 below and a gang war heats up, it&#39;s up to Cassie to help restore law and order. But is she in over her head? As she is propelled on a collision course with a murderous enemy, she finds that the key to it all might come in the most unlikely form: a boy on a bike named Kyle. He keeps showing up where he doesn&#39;t belong. And he seems to know something that Cassie does not about what lies beneath the surface of this small and troubled town... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The unrelenting cold makes this the perfect beach read.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
