The British Government needs to decide whether to put Rudolph He?, Hitler’s deputy, on trial on for war crimes. He? flew to Britain in 1941 but no one has been able to work out why he came as he neither sought political asylum nor brought peace proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holmes is commissioned to carry out the interrogation of He?. This proves to be a highly dramatic affair as it reveals not only the totally unexpected reason for He?’s flight but also some completely unknown facts about Hitler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Watson’s papers on this case were only discovered in the summer of 2015 and this is the first time the true story can be told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Orlando Pearson&lt;/b&gt;, creator of the well-known &lt;i&gt;Redacted Sherlock Holmes series&lt;/i&gt;, commutes into London during the day and communes with the spirits of Baker Street by night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international businessman, his interests include classical music, history, literature, current affairs, sport and economics. All these themes find their way into his stories which are being translated into German and Italian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Pearson is married with two children and lives near Wisteria Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
