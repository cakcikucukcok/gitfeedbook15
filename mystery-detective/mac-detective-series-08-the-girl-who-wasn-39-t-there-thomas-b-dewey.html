  <title>Mac Detective Series 08: The Girl Who Wasn&#39;t There - Thomas B. Dewey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The trail Mac found himself trying to follow was very cold. Another private detective -- his friend Barry Henley -- had been killed a year earlier in a fall from a tenth-story window, and the cops had written it off as accidental. But when Hensley&#39;s widow told Mac that several people had tried to get into her apartment under various pretexts; when Mac found she was being followed; and when the mug shot she picked out of the police department files proved to be that of a very tough egg, Whiskey Davis -- suddenly Henley&#39;s death began to look like murder. Mac knew for sure when the next death couldn&#39;t have been accidental. A bomb that blows up car and driver when the ignition is turned is never anything but murder....&lt;P&gt; &quot;Mac is one of our best private eyes.&quot; -- San Francisco Chronicle&lt;P&gt; &quot;Thomas B. Dewey is one of detective fiction&#39;s severely underrated writers!&quot; -- Bill Pronzini&lt;P&gt; &quot;More than one rub-out for private eye Mac to run through when a man with a well-minked wife is shot down by a police sergeant from Steel City, outside of Chicago. Exit also for an attorney, a safecracker and assorted others who are linked to the importance of teenage Marianne, the rehabilitation project of moneyman Lloyd, and a series of black-mailing pictures. Scrappy all the way.&quot; -- Kirkus Reviews&lt;P&gt; &quot;Mac has been called one of the most believable and humane PI&#39;s in crime fiction. He is reluctant to use either his gun or his fists, but will do so when the situation demands it, or in self-defense; he doesn&#39;t merely solve his clients&#39; cases, but provides moral support and sympathy as well; and perhaps most notable of all, Mac feels, and is not afraid to show itópain, loss, sorrow, loneliness.&quot; --thrillingdetective.com" />
