      <meta name="description" content="Terror outfits in Asia are looking beyond the 9/11 episode to terrorize the world with nuclear devices. Rogue nuclear scientists involved in smuggling and dissemination of WMD technologies are eager to help Al Qaeda and similar groups in achieving their objectives. Russian mafia groups are arranging sale of nuclear scrap retrieved from ICBM&#39;s dismantled under SALT Treaty agreements to whoever is willing to pay in bullion and US Dollars. Indian Intelligence agencies discover a major money laundering operation in Mumbai. A British hydrocarbon specialist working at a major drilling site is kidnapped and taken to Myanmar as hostage. The Tamil Tiger guerillas of Sri Lanka demand the British Government release a Lankan rogue scientist undergoing prison term for smuggling contraband nuclear material, in exchange of the hostage in Myanmar. The murder of a senior executive involved in the money laundering operations in Mumbai sends Indian sleuths on tracing money trails to Sri Lanka, Bangkok and Chiang Mai. The daring rescue of a Bangladesh nuclear scientist held captive for three decades and blackmailed to work on a project of WMD&#39;s by the ISI, exposes the conspiracy to arm Qaeda with nuclear devices." />
