  <title>Charm City - Laura Lippman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a practiced reporter until her newspaper went to that great pressroom in the sky, P.I.

It&#39;s a quirky city where baseball reigns, but lately homicide seems to be the second most popular local sport. Business tycoon &quot;Wink&quot; Wynkowski is trying to change all that by bringing pro basketball back to town, and everybody&#39;s rooting fro him -- until a devastating, muckraking expose of his lurid past appears on the front page of the Baltimore Beacon-Light.

Instead, the piece killed Wink -- who&#39;s found in his garage with the car running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the Blight wants to nail the unknown computer hacker who planted the lethal story, and the assignment is right up the alley of a former newshound like Tess. But it doesn&#39;t take long for her to discover deeper, darker secrets, and to realize that this situation is really more about whacking than hacking.
