  <title>The Loch Ness Papers - Paige Shelton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bookseller Delaney Nichols befriends a Loch Ness monster enthusiast; when he stands accused of murder she&#39;ll do whatever it takes to learn who the killer is--and whether Nessie herself is really lurking in the Scottish waters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaney Nichols is delighted with her life in Edinburgh, working at The Cracked Spine--a shop that specializes in hard-to-find books and artifacts. With a job she loves, and her fast approaching marriage to devastatingly handsome Scottish pub-owner Tom Shannon, Delaney&#39;s life could be straight out of a fairy tale--at least it would be, if the pastor meant to perform the wedding ceremony hadn&#39;t recently passed away. Outside the church where Delaney is searching for another reverend, she stumbles across Norval Fraser: an elderly man obsessed with the Loch Ness monster. Always attracted to the interesting and unusual, Delaney befriends Norval. But when his nephew is found dead, the police decide Norval&#39;s obsession has moved from monsters to murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a wedding to plan, her family arriving soon from Kansas, and the arrival of an over-the-top Texan with a wildly valuable book, Delaney&#39;s plate is full to bursting, but she can&#39;t abandon her new friend. Determined to help Norval, she sets out to learn the truth. The Loch Ness buries its secrets deeply, but Delaney is determined to dig them up--whether Nessie likes it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in Edinburgh, Scotland, &lt;i&gt;The Loch Ness Papers&lt;/i&gt; is the fourth in the Scottish Bookshop series by Paige Shelton.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
