  <title>Black Thunder - Aimée Thurlo, David Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A construction crew found the first body. The cops found three more, in a cluster that lay on both sides of the border of the Navajo Reservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because some of the bodies were buried outside the Rez, Navajo Police Special Investigator Ella Clah and her team must work a delicate joint investigation with the New Mexico police. Identifying the dead isn&#39;t easy--some had been buried for years--and at first the cases look to be nothing but dead ends. Then one of the bodies turns out to be that of a missing man who was believed to have embezzled funds from his construction firm and suspicions focus on the man&#39;s partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no obvious links between any of the corpses and the anniversary of their deaths fast approaching, Ella feels frustrated by the investigation&#39;s lack of progress. Unless they can find what connects these victims, someone else may soon be killed. Ella&#39;s ability to concentrate is battered by worries about her teenage daughter, who has been skipping school, and her mother, who is cooking up a storm, a sure sign that trouble is brewing in the household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Thunder&lt;/i&gt;, an Ella Clah novel, is a police procedural mystery that should appeal to all readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
