      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A wealthy businessman has died under suspicious circumstances.  A Christmas with the family provides more drama than could be expected. A girl accuses the hospital of killing her grandmother.  In 16th Century Scotland, the death of a clansman is not what it first appears. &lt;br&gt;From the investigations of Inspector C. D. Sloan and his enthusiastic, all-too-constant, but not very helpful sidekick Constable Crosby of the Calleshire C.I.D. to the travails of Henry Tyler of the Foreign Office, from the mysterious Malcolm Venables of the Secret Service to Sheriff Rhuaraidh Macmillan of 16th century Scotland, Catherine Aird&#39;s latest collection of literate, delightful tales takes the reader through the full range of  crime and punishment. Aird&#39;s mix of deft plotting, charming wit, and clever writing has made her one of the most engaging and enduring traditional crime writers.  In her latest volume, all of her considerable gifts as a storyteller are on display.&lt;/p&gt;" />
