  <title>A Case of Greed - Don L. McCarty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1997 when retired attorney, Austin Wells, receives a desperate phone call from his former friend, Adele Ogden. Her brother, Frankie, has been reported being murdered in Ensenada, Mexico. After Austin reluctantly agrees to accompany her to Mexico to temporarily help sort things out, he has no idea he is about to walk into a complex mystery mired in malice, greed, and betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nothing to go on but a phone call from an unknow caller, the two leave San Diego for Mexico to determine if and why Frankie was killed. After finally locating a body in the morgue, Austin and Adele begin gathering facts from the locals and the American Embassy that soon leads them to believe Frankies death was part of a larger conspiracy. But it is only when the pair returns to San Diego that they discover that Frankie has bequeathed his property to unlikely recipients, further complicating a mystery that ultimately leads them back in time to World War II and into the depths of the Catholic Church where they uncover a shocking truth about Frankie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this murder mystery, the past and present collide with ethical ironies as a secret is unveiled and a tenacious attorney attempts to piece together a conspiracy in time to save its innocent victims from a bleak destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
