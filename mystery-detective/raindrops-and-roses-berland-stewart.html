  <title>Raindrops and Roses - Berland Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Berland Bill Stewart is a Jamaican who went to the U.K. after graduating High School.
After several years of struggles he served the Royal Air Force for five interesting years in the U.K. and the Middle East and eventually gained National recognition as an athlete and heavyweight boxing champion.
On his return to the U.K from his military tour overseas he attended and
graduated from the British Institute of Engineering Technology, a private Engineering
Institution in London England.
Berland returned to Jamaica after spending 12 years in the U.K. when he met
and marry Sybil a secretary in the Jamaica Civil Service.
He has been successfully married now for over 40 years and the proud parent of
four successful college graduates and grand children.
After working with the Jamaica Civil Service as an Engineer he relocated to the
U.S.A. with his family where they currently reside.
Despite his engineering training in the U.K. Berland had to further qualify
himself educationally to meet the prescribed U.S.A. requirement.
This requirement was met when he graduated in Architectural Drafting and
subsequently employed by the N.Y. City Board of Education.
After years of secretarial employment Sybil also had to be retrained, graduated
and worked as a Registered Nurse before her retirement.
The thought of being a successful grandfather is a fulfillment of his dreams, and
believes that with perseverance the pursuit of ones goals should never be underestimated." />
