      <meta name="description" content="Joanna is a young woman who invests herself completely in her job at the seaside hotel. Will she get the recognition she has been hoping for from her father, Rodolphe G. Gaspardin, one of these days? And just what intentions does her brother, Joshua, really have? It&#39;s obvious there are secrets. For Joanna, juggling between her private life and professional life is no easy task. Difficulties arise where she doesn&#39;t expect them. She finds herself driving her new neighbour, Guillermo, to the emergency room. Thankfully, there is no lack of wonderful adventures. As proof, she runs into the seductive Paul who invites her to dinner…&lt;br/&gt;
