&lt;p&gt;As Teddy Sanderson hurries through the city park, a pedestrian bumps against herand then falls dead at her feet. When its discovered the victim was murdered, the local papers share the details of Teddys life, making her vulnerable to attacks from crackpots around town and from her paroled ex-husband, who wants her dead. Due to the notoriety of the case, Teddy becomes entangled in the activities of a secret organization known as the Delphi Alliance and in the work of the FBI as they attempt to curtail Alliance plans.&lt;/p&gt;
