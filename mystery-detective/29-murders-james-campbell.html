  <title>29 Murders - James Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="29 MURDERS is based on a factual murder investigation of 29 murders of the famous Missing and Murdered Children case in Atlanta that took place from 1979 to 1981. Convicted and sentenced to life in a Georgia State prison was Wayne Williams for only two of the twenty-nine murders, a conviction that left many people around the country asking; if he only killed 2, who then killed the other 27?  However, along came an anonymous letter that was written to Police Chief, Barry Mason describing its writer as being the real killer after thirty years of complete silence. This letter sparked a new investigation into a thirty year old case for fear the real killer had re-emerged. In charge of the investigation was Lieutenant Seville Patterson, who later convinced her retired police husband, John Sinclair to work with her on the case, because she feared that she could not trust anyone in the department. John on the other hand agreed to work with her because he believed that this was a very dangerous case, and it could get her killed if he did not work with her. And even with him on the case, both their lives were in danger. As a team, they set out to solve a case that was believed to be an impossible case to solve. And that belief was justified, because the two cops found themselves in a direct line of fire of a conspiracy that was reaching all the way to Washington, DC as well in the headquarters of the CIA. And they also found trouble in their own back yard, when they discovered that nine of the ten original police investigators on the case thirty years ago had all mysteriously met their demise, except one." />
