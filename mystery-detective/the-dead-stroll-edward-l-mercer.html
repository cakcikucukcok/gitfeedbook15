  <title>The Dead Stroll - Edward L. Mercer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The life of a homicide cop is death with many causes: death for love, death for&lt;BR&gt;
hate, death for revenge, death for money or death for no reason at all. The&lt;BR&gt;
homicide cops worst nightmare is death by a serial killer with a plan. This gritty&lt;BR&gt;
and fast moving story of a search for such a killer is a realistic portrayal of homicide&lt;BR&gt;
investigation written by a former homicide detective who has been there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
I was a homicide investigator during the time frame of this novel and I am&lt;BR&gt;
impressed with the detail and account of both the technical and routine phases&lt;BR&gt;
of murder investigations as we did them back in the day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Gerald R. Beavers&lt;BR&gt;
Former Chief of Police, Asheville, North Carolina and Topeka, Kansas&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
A fresh homicide on the street. Grab your pen and notebook and get to the&lt;BR&gt;
scene. Beat the bushes. Talk to the street cops who show up. Talk to the&lt;BR&gt;
street people whose trust you have developed over the years  bartenders,&lt;BR&gt;
prostitutes, crooks, store owners.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The drums are beating in the neighborhood. People are talking. Get the right&lt;BR&gt;
information and you solve the case. No DNA; no C. S. I.; no cell phones; no online&lt;BR&gt;
information sources. No psychological profi les other than the knowledge&lt;BR&gt;
and memory of sharp cops. No scientifi c interrogation techniques other than&lt;BR&gt;
experience and knowledge of human nature. We found the killers and we put&lt;BR&gt;
them away.&lt;BR&gt;
This is the way it was in the late 1960s and Ed Mercer captures the tableau&lt;BR&gt;
perfectly. The Dead Stroll is a nostalgia trip for those of us who walked the&lt;BR&gt;
walk and talked the talk in those days and a historical document for those&lt;BR&gt;
cops currently working homicides  an authentic depiction of how it was. The&lt;BR&gt;
scenes of riot and turmoil in the streets, the pressures of external and internal&lt;BR&gt;
politics, the cops wit and crisp dialogue are all vivid and real. Dont miss this&lt;BR&gt;
great read which is told in a way that only be written by a guy who has been&lt;BR&gt;
there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
