  <title>Trail of Echoes - Rachel Howzell Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trail of Echoes: &lt;/i&gt;the latest Elouise Norton novel from critically acclaimed writer Rachel Howzell Hall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a rainy spring day in Los Angeles, homicide detective Elouise &quot;Lou&quot; Norton is called away from a rare lunch date to Bonner Park, where the body of thirteen-year-old Chanita Lords has been discovered.  When Lou and her partner, Colin Taggert, take on the sad task of informing Chanita&#39;s mother, Lou is surprised to find herself in the apartment building she grew up in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanita was interested in photography and, much like Lou, a girl destined to leave the housing projects behind. Her death fits a chilling pattern of exceptional girls--dancers, artists, honors scholars-gone recently missing in the same school district, the one Lou attended not so long ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lou is valiantly trying to make a go of life after her divorce and doing everything she can to avoid her long estranged father. She races to catch a serial killer, but he remains frustratingly out of her reach, sending cryptic cyphers and taunting clues that arrive too late to prevent the next death. This one is personal, and it&#39;s only a matter of time before he comes after Lou herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gives voice to a rare figure in crime fiction: a highly complex, fully imagined black female detective.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, Starred Review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
