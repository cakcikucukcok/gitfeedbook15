  <title>Beware the Mall Stalker - Louis F Newcomb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shopping malls, or fashion malls, are where most people prefer to do their shopping. Promenades by another name, they offer a one-stop marketplace to satisfy most buyers. A mall also provides shoppers with an indoor covered atmosphere, an air-conditioned shelter and safe haven where one can spend an entire day leisurely browsing from store to store before indulging in one of the many food outlets available. Some malls also offer various attractions and amenities aside from the usual shops.	
&lt;P&gt;	
	Conversely a mall is also an area where the less desirables may wander about for lack of anywhere else to prowl. They are there not to shop, at least for merchandise per se, but to observe and stare at the attractive faces parading around. Malls are filled with girls and women of all ages, innocently going about their business unaware that perhaps someone is being more than merely gawked at. Perhaps some creep may be lurking, watching and waiting until his chosen one appears. And when she does, that same foreboding, diabolical fiend may choose to follow the alluring prey, one particular shopper who is preparing to exit the mall and return to her vehicle and then, just maybe, her worst nightmare occurs" />
