  <title>A Mist of Prophecies - Steven Saylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During the Roman Civil War, as the forces of Pompey and Julius Caesar fight a series of battles in the provinces over control of the Republic, Rome itself is a hotbed of intrigue as those left behind wait for word. In this tentative and treacherous environment, a beautiful young seeress is murdered in the marketplace. Possibly mad and claiming no memory of her own past, Cassandra - like her namesake - is reputed to have had the true gift of prophecy and, as a result, she became a confidante of the rich and powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordianus the Finder, who had become obsessed with the woman and her mystery, starts to investigate her murder. As the political situation in Rome continues to decay, the citizenry veers towards ruin, and everyone waits for word out in the far off fields of war, Gordianus begins to peel away the veils of secrecy that surround Cassandra&#39;s life and death. What lies underneath involves one, possibly many, of the most powerful women in Rome and the truth could not only put Gordianus&#39;s life in danger but affect the very future of Rome itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
