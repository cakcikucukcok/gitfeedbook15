  <title>Banished - Don Goodman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Transplanted Canadian Doug Loggins is the new principal at Palm Oasis High School-in a small desert community located in California&#39;s Colorado Desert. A local tribe, the Napoc Band of Whitewater Indians, flaunting state law, open a gaming &lt;I&gt;Casino&lt;/I&gt;. Doug must deal with ancient squabbles, local politics, and disputes about the meaning of sovereignty in addition to his own administrative duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these ordeals are nothing compared to the situation he faces when one of his students, Simone Garcia, turns up dead. Loggins and authorities suspect a drug related death, but in pursuing justice they butt heads with the leader of the Napoc nation, Reginald &quot;Cisco&quot; Tramhurst, a powerful figure who was instrumental in getting the &lt;I&gt;Casino&lt;/I&gt; built on Indian land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Loggins joins forces with the beautiful Anna Carpenter, a recently divorced Palm Oasis prosecuting attorney, he&#39;s surprised at their instant attraction. But the closer they come to the chilling truth surrounding Simone&#39;s death, the more their newly burgeoning relationship is threatened. In chasing the links to Simone&#39;s death, Doug encounters a life threatening attack, an entrepreneur of questionable character, a frequently contumacious peace officer, a double named attorney and the true survivor, Brutus. In a desperate chase, Doug takes to the air to find a killer and save a life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
