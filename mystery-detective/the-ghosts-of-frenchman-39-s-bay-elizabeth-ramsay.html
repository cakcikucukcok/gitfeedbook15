  <title>The Ghosts of Frenchman&#39;s Bay - Elizabeth Ramsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stricken by the recent death of her mother, 33-year-old Alexandra Gortchakova moves from Washington to the secluded Calabrese Estate in Sorrento, Maine. She needs time to put behind her mother&#39;s lifelong animus towards her and to weigh the odds of resuming life with her boyfriend, John Hefner, currently under contractual obligations in Brazil. Despite its idyllic splendor, Alex soon learns that the estate has been plagued by a series of tragedies.   On her first day at the estate, Alex also makes the acquaintance of a ruggedly handsome man, Jason Faulk, who helps her move into the lodge the morning of her arrival.   But dark clouds are gathering over her secluded paradise. Within a week of settling in, Alex is confronted by a series of disturbing events.   In the end and after many surprises, it is the death of a close friend which--at the risk of their own lives--will become the catalyst for Alex and her childhood friend Tina St. James to uncover the true secret of the Calabrese Estate." />
