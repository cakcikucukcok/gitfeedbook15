  <title>The Libran - Alan Hywel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After Jack had sacrificed his life to save refugee children in a Rwandan village school, he was re-incarnated again as The Libran and sent back to earth in a race against time to save one child that was destined for much greater things and become vital to the future of mankind. 
Forced to protect and work together with an alcoholic and drug addicted woman that has all of the characteristics and habits he detests most, Jack needs to work and move quickly whilst avoiding the Mastermind behind an undetected and untouchable organization that abuses children, a powerful member of the Danish Government and a chapter of Hells Angels that are all closing in on them and wanting them permanently silenced - at all costs to protect their business and reputations. 
Jack uncovers webs of untruths, twists and turns along every pathway - and to the very end - still not knowing who he can genuinely trust or rely on. Using his instincts and experience whilst battling with his own inner, emotional conflicts and past, he decides to turn the tables from being the hunter, looking for a needle in a haystack, into becoming the prey and inviting his powerful adversaries to bring the battle to him. 
With the force of Nature on his side and defying the force of Time, he is answerable only to The Father and Jack will do whatever he needs to succeed and restore the balance." />
