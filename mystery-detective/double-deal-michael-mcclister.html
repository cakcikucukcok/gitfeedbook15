  <title>Double Deal - Michael McClister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elmo Finn, first introduced in McClister&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Victim&#39;s Choice&lt;/i&gt;, is a former CIA commando as well as a number of other things, although very few people could tell you exactly what. An old Vietnam buddy of Elmo&#39;s, now the governor of Tennessee, has been receiving death threats. As the governor and his &#39;body men&#39; struggle to improve security, little do they expect that the immediate threat is posed by Elmo Finn himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Elmo stealthily penetrates the governor&#39;s inner sanctum, another crisis erupts -- the governor&#39;s wife is kidnapped. Instead of cold cash, the kidnappers demand an unusual ransom -- the release from prison of a convicted bank robber, whom they mysteriously label a &#39;political prisoner.&#39; The call goes out to Elmo&#39;s old Vietnam cadre, they quickly assemble in Nashville, and the game is afoot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Tennessee is not Vietnam, it has its own brand of guerillas -- a shadowy religious cult-cum-well-armed militia that soon becomes the chief suspect in the twisting, turning hunt for the First Lady. The surprises that keep popping up, and the tricks that Elmo and his men learned in war, will fascinate readers and keep them glued to the pages as this action-packed story unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
