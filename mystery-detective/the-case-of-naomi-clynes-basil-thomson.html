  <title>The Case of Naomi Clynes - Basil Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The &lt;/i&gt;late&lt;i&gt; Miss Clynes, sir? How dreadful. It must have been very sudden.”&lt;br&gt; “It was.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Naomi Clynes was found dead, her head in the gas-oven. She left a suicide note, but Richardson, newly promoted to the rank of Inspector in the C.I.D., soon has cause to think this is a case of murder. With scarcely a clue beyond a postmark and a postage stamp, treasured by the deceased, he succeeds in bringing home the crime to a person whom no one would have suspected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Case of Naomi Clynes&lt;/i&gt; was originally published in 1934. This new edition, the first in many decades, features an introduction by crime novelist Martin Edwards, author of acclaimed genre history &lt;i&gt;The Golden Age of Murder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Sir Basil Thomson is a past-master in the mysteries of Scotland Yard, and this novel is a highly capable piece of work…A brisk story, skilfully told.” &lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A first-class thriller. Written with lively vigour and a realism that can only come from an author who knows his subject, it can be wholeheartedly recommended as the best detective story of the week.” &lt;i&gt;Sunday Referee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
