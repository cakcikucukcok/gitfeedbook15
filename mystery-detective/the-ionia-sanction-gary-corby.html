  <title>The Ionia Sanction - Gary Corby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Corby has not only made Greek history accessible--he&#39;s made it first-rate entertainment.&quot; --Kelli Stanley, award-winning author of&lt;/i&gt; Nox Dormienda &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; City of Dragons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Athens, 460 B.C.  Life&#39;s tough for Nicolaos, the only investigating agent in ancient Athens.  His girlfriend&#39;s left him and his boss wants to fire him.  But when an Athenian official is murdered, the brilliant statesman Pericles has no choice but to put Nico on the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case takes Nico, in the company of a beautiful slave girl, to the land of Ionia within the Persian Empire.  The Persians will execute him on the spot if they think he&#39;s a spy.  Beyond that, there are only a few minor problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s being chased by brigands who are only waiting for the right price before they kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow he has to placate his girlfriend, who is very angry about that slave girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He must meet Themistocles, the military genius who saved Greece during the Persian Wars, and then  defected to the hated enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to solve the crime, Nico must uncover a secret that could not only destroy Athens, but will force him to choose between love, and ambition, and his own life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
