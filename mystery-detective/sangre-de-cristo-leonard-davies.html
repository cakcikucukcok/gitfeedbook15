	&lt;p&gt;Alfred Curran is the sole heir to the Sangre de Cristo agricultural empire. When he returns to run it he realizes it is a corrupt feudal state.  Before he can uncover the culprits he goes to Mexico where his car plunges over a cliff and he is left for dead.   Peasants find his mutilated body and take him to clinic funded by drug money where the doctor in charge reconstructs his mutilated face. Curran has lost his memory and before he recovers it he and the doctor are arrested and thrown into the living hell of Los Altos Prison.  When Curran recovers his memory and escapes from Los Altos he discovers that he has been framed for murder and that his wife and land have been stolen.  He assumes a new identity and returns to the Sangre for revenge.  He finds redemption and the woman he loves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
