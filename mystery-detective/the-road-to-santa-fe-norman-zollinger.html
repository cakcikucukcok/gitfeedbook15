  <title>The Road to Santa Fe - Norman Zollinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enrique &quot;Rick&quot; Garcia, district attorney in the small New Mexico county of Chupadera, is a man of principle, a strange breed in the rough-and-tumble politics of his state. When he is tapped to run for governor, he will learn just how rocky the road to Santa Fe really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has a mortal enemy in Stanford Brown, a wealthy rancher Garcia convicted of manslaughter. From his prison cell Brown promises revenge on his former college football teammate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All through his campaign Garcia has been guided and encouraged by Ashley McCarver, an attorney and state Democratic Party operative. Ashley&#39;s relationship to her candidate evolves from campaign manager for a man she admires into an abiding love for him. Garcia, still haunted by the suicide of his wife, at first sees in Ashley only her professionalism and encyclopedic knowledge of state politics, but the election draws the pair inexorably together: after Garcia&#39;s political triumph the two marry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Stanford Brown, freed from prison through a gubernatorial pardon granted by Garcia&#39;s predecessor, begins to unfold an elaborate and cunning plot to have his rival impeached.  Will this attempt to jeopardize Garcias political life become a serious threat?  And will this shadow from the past  cement or destroy his burgeoning relationship with Ashley?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meticulously researched by a master historical novelist, &lt;i&gt;The Road to Santa Fe&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates Norman Zollinger&#39;s skill in creating three-dimensional contemporary characters.  He also brings to life the complicated behind-the-scenes machinations of the strange world of New Mexico politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
