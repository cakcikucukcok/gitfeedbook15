  <title>The Last Girl - Jane Casey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maeve Kerrigan [is] a fascinating and plausible character...What she has is persistence, integrity and emotional intelligence, and a very deft way of insinuating herself into a reader&#39;s affections.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Irish Independent&lt;/i&gt; (UK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vast wealth offers London defense attorney Philip Kennford a lot of things: a gorgeous house with a pool in the backyard, connections in the top echelons of society, a wardrobe worthy of Milan runways. But his money doesn&#39;t provide a happy marriage, or good relationships with his twin daughters...and it does nothing to protect his family when someone brutally murders his wife and daughter in their own home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Detective Constable Maeve Kerrigan arrives at the scene, the two survivors--Philip and his second favorite daughter, Lydia--both claim to have seen nothing, but it&#39;s clear right away that this is an unhappy family accustomed to keeping secrets. Maeve soon finds herself entangled in a case with a thousand leads that all seem to point nowhere, and it doesn&#39;t help that her boss, whom she trusts more than almost anyone, is starting to make decisions that Maeve finds questionable at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Last Girl&lt;/i&gt;, Jane Casey once again demonstrates her ability to write vivid, three-dimensional characters and spin a gripping, unpredictable mystery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
