  <title>Riley Paige Mystery: Once Pined (#6) and Once Forsaken (#7) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A bundle of books #6 (ONCE PINED) and #7 (ONCE FORSAKEN) in Blake Pierce&#39;s Riley Paige Mystery series-which begins with ONCE GONE, a #1 bestseller with over 900 five star reviews-and a free download! This bundle offers books #6 and #7 in one convenient file, with over 130,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ONCE PINED, Men and women are turning up dead in the outskirts of Seattle, poisoned by a mysterious chemical. When a pattern is discovered and it becomes clear that a twisted serial killer is on the hunt, the FBI calls in their best asset: Special Agent Riley Paige. Riley is urged to return to the line of duty-but Riley, still reeling from the attacks on her family, is loath to return. Yet as bodies mount, and the murders become more inexplicable, Riley knows she has no choice. The case takes Riley deep into the unsettling world of nursing homes, of hospitals, of drifting caretakers and psychotic patients. As Riley delves deeper into the mind of the murderer, she realizes she is hunting the most terrifying killer of all: one whose madness knows no depths-and yet who may just appear shockingly ordinary.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ONCE FORSAKEN, When Special Agent Riley Paige finally decides to take a well-needed rest from the FBI, a request for help comes from the most unlikely source: her own daughter. April&#39;s best friend is devastated by the death of her sister, a freshman at Georgetown. Worse, she is convinced that the suicide was staged, and that her sister was murdered at the hands of a serial killer. Riley reluctantly looks into the case, only to discover that two other freshman girls at Georgetown recently killed themselves in the same grotesque way-by hanging. As she realizes foul play may be afoot, she brings in the FBI. The case takes Riley deep into the privileged campus of one of the world&#39;s most esteemed universities, into the unsettling world of the wealthy and driven families that pushed their children to succeed. In time she discovers that this case is far more twisted than it seems-and that she just may be up against the most psychotic killer of her career. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, the Riley Paige mysteries are a riveting new series-with a beloved new character-that will leave you turning pages late into the night." />
