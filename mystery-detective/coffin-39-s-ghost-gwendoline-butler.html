  <title>Coffin&#39;s Ghost - Gwendoline Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a few ghosts in their closets, but John Coffin, Chief Commander of the Second City of London&#39;s Police believes that his are all safely tucked away. In fact, recently recovered from a gunshot wound, Coffin is hoping for a calmer life with his actress wife Stella Pinero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, life has other plans for him. Coffin learns that all of his ghosts are not behind him when a parcel containing dismembered limbs is found outside a woman&#39;s refuge. The Serena Seddon Shelter for battered wives is located on Barrow Street, not far from Coffin&#39;s own home. But the link to Coffin is more sinister than mere proximity: his initials are written on the package and the shelter is housed in the building where he lived when he first arrived in the Second City. This discovery opens a door through which troop a succession of horrible and violent events including sudden death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffin&#39;s Ghost is another sterling entry in a series that has been continually praised for its ability to delve into the darker side of life and will leave readers wondering just how safe their secrets are.&lt;/p&gt;" />
