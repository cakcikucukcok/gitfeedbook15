  <title>The Campus Detective - Dave Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since childhood, George Wesson has been besieged with anxiety, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). He desperately wants to overcome his debilitations, and enrolling at the University of Washington to study criminology might just do the trick.
As a member of the University Police Department, thirty-one-year-old George becomes an ace detective. Along with his partner, Danny Smith, he has earned a reputation for solving crimes without calling in the local police department. But his skills and resolve are tested when he starts investigating a series of brutal murders committed on campus. 
When it becomes apparent that he may be on the killers hit list, Georges paranoia rears its ugly head and almost derails him. He seeks help from a psychologist, and the advice he receives helps him realize his adversary is only human. But even more, George discovers the psychological thorn in his own flesh could be the sword that defeats this frightening foe.
With a unique hero and a fast-paced plot, &lt;i&gt;The Campus Detective&lt;/i&gt; delivers a thrilling murder mystery and reveals how one mans downfall may just be his salvation." />
