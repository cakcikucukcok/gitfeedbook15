  <title>In the Wrong Hands - Victor Mudrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1988 the United States Army Pershing Missile Systems (about 400 strong) were, reportedly, retired from service in Eastern Europe, transported back to the United States and destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, how do we know these deadly, nuclear tipped missiles were all actually destroyed?  The government has made mistakes before and has even been known to conspire to cover up those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this story of fiction, one of the missiles does get misplaced by the Army and ends up in the hands of people who plan to use it on the population of London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spence and Harper, best friends since childhood, are engaged by the president of the United States to retrieve or destroy the threat and eliminate the people involved.  At the same time, they are to keep any news of the incident from the world. The rescue plan puts them in the middle of a typhoon on a leaking freighter, in a firefight with elite commandos, at the bottom of the ocean and finally face to face with their arch nemisis Sean Doogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiple story lines weave an exciting tale all over the Americas and Europe. And tie together in an amazing and unexpected ending.  The fun and suspense is non-stop. You will be on the edge of your chair one minute and laughing out loud the next.&lt;/p&gt;" />
