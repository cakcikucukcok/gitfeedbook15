  <title>Kill You Twice - Chelsea Cain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nothing makes Portland detective Archie Sheridan happier than knowing that Gretchen Lowell--the serial killer whose stunning beauty is belied by the gruesome murders she&#39;s committed--is locked away in a psych ward. Archie can finally heal from the near-fatal physical and emotional wounds she&#39;s inflicted on him and start moving on with his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, Archie throws himself into the latest case to come across his desk: A cyclist has discovered a corpse in Mount Tabor Park on the eastern side of Portland. The man was gagged, skinned, and found hanging by his wrists from a tree. It&#39;s the work of a killer bold and clever enough to torture his victim for hours on a sunny summer morning in a big public park and yet leave no trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then Archie gets a message he can&#39;t ignore--Gretchen claims to have inside knowledge about this grisly murder. Archie finally agrees to visit Gretchen, because he can&#39;t risk losing his only lead in the case. At least, that&#39;s what he tells himself . . . but the ties between Archie and Gretchen have always been stronger, deeper, and more complex than he&#39;s willing to admit, even to himself. What game is she playing this time? And even more frightening, what long-hidden secrets from Gretchen&#39;s past have been dredged up that someone would kill to protect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At once terrifying and magnetic, &quot;Beauty Killer&quot; Gretchen Lowell returns with a vengeance in &lt;i&gt;Kill You Twice,&lt;/i&gt; Chelsea Cain&#39;s latest razor-sharp psychological thriller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
