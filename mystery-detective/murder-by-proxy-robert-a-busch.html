  <title>Murder by Proxy - Robert A. Busch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Dermatologist Dr. Richard Carnes ran a successful clinic, but for various reasons several  Former patients felt justified in being angry enough at him to want him dead.  Someone stabbed him to death, in the heart, one early Saturday evening.  Was it a former patient? Or was it someone elsehis wife?  His lawyer?  Or was it merely because of a robbery that got out of hand?&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;What had been the killers motive?  Vengeance seemed to be a possible motive, but the widow may have had another reason, and attorney Justin Douglas stood to gain the largest financial benefit from the doctors death.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Orange Grove, Florida police team of Beth Reed and Bob Garcia put their heads together to find the killer and establish the motive, simultaneously finding clues about each other that could put their careers in jeopardy.&lt;/P&gt;" />
