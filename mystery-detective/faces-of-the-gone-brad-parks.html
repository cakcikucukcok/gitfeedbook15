  <title>Faces of the Gone - Brad Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Four bodies, each with a single bullet wound in the back of the head, stacked like cordwood in a weed-choked vacant lot: That&#39;s the front-page news facing Carter Ross, investigative reporter with the&lt;i&gt; Newark Eagle-Examiner&lt;/i&gt;.  Immediately dispatched to the scene, Carter learns that the four victims--an exotic dancer, a drug dealer, a hustler, and a mama&#39;s boy--came from different parts of the city and didn&#39;t seem to know one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police, eager to calm jittery residents, leak a theory that the murders are revenge for a bar stickup, and Carter&#39;s paper, hungry for a scoop, hastily prints it. Carter doesn&#39;t come from the streets, but he understands a thing or two about Newark&#39;s neighborhoods. And he knows there are no quick answers when dealing with a crime like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to uncover the true story, he enlists the aide of Tina Thompson, the paper&#39;s smoking-hot city editor, to run interference at the office; Tommy Hernandez, the paper&#39;s gay Cuban intern, to help him with legwork on the streets; and Tynesha Dales, a local stripper, to take him to Newark&#39;s underside. It turns out that the four victims have one connection after all, and this knowledge will put Carter on the path of one very ambitious killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Faces of the Gone &lt;/i&gt;by Brad Parks won the Shamus Award for Best First Novel and the Nero Award for Best American Mystery--it is the first book to receive both awards.
