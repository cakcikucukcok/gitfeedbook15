  <title>The Designated Survivor - Neil Pollack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tim Connor has just lost his father, a Vietnam veteran, to an untimely death. His girlfriend, Allie, tries to support him, but she has plans of her own that involve leaving Baltimore and embarking on a new acting career. The death of Tim&amp;rsquo;s father, however, inadvertently involves the young couple in a plot that could get them both killed. A domestic terrorist group is planning to attack the United States government. Led by the ruthless Vance Galvin, this group hopes to kill off the president, as well as everyone in his line of succession, leaving only Galvin&amp;rsquo;s inside man to act as commander in chief. This leading man will survive the DC doomsday and create an America to match the ideals of the Founding Fathers: a white Christian nation. Galvin has amassed conventional ordnance and weapons of mass destruction that will give him his revenge. He blames the US government for the death of his family at Waco, Texas, in 1993, and he longs to purify his homeland. Galvin believes Tim has information that could ruin the plan, but Galvin has made things too personal, which can get messy, and now his perfect plan could fall to pieces at the hands of a veteran&amp;rsquo;s son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neil Pollack&lt;/em&gt; received his PhD from New York University. He is the author of &lt;em&gt;Almost Armageddon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Rosetta Cylinder&lt;/em&gt;. His work has been featured in many national and local magazines and newspapers. He lives with his wife on Long Island, New York, and in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;" />
