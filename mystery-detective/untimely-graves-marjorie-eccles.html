  <title>Untimely Graves - Marjorie Eccles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A new novel in the popular DS Gil Mayo series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the murdered body of a woman is found floating in flooded uplands near an isolated farm and nearby cottage, it poses problems of identification, prompting the press to dub her the &#39;Mystery Woman.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is she?  As time goes by, Detective Superintendent Gil Mayo and his assistant Inspector Abigail Moon, begin to fear that question is destined to remain unanswered, until the bursar of a public school, currently involved in controversy over a proposed new entrance to the school, is murdered at his desk.  Though the murders are seemingly unrelated, events begin to show that this is not so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a temporarily unemployed ex-student, Cleo Atkins will do anything rather than take the safe secretarial position her mother has lined up for her, even to taking a job with Maid to Order, a firm of cleaning contractors, something her mother feels she is singularly unfitted for.  The firm is much in demand following the trail of destruction left by the floods, and working with the team Cleo comes across evidence from a totally unexpected source, and ultimately finds herself involved in the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her cooperation, Mayo and Moon are able to follow a chain of events that eventually lead to the identity of the Mystery Woman being revealed, and to the unexpected solution of both murders.&lt;/p&gt;" />
