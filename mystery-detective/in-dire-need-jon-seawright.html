  <title>In Dire Need - Jon Seawright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This morning Mary Barton received an unexpected phone call from her ex-husband, Bad Bob. This troubled her, as she now drove to meet him at clear Lake State Park.of all places as this was where they use to secretly meet while dating in high school. He told her he needed to go over financial things that were divided up during their divorce.But Mary never had a chance to see him again alive.
As her head started to clear and the pain subsided enough for her to be cognizant, Mary slowly realized that she had been struck over the head, back at the park, and now was held captive in the truck of a moving vehicle. But it wasnt just any car. It was her own. Then, out of nowhere, it was suddenly rear-ended by two carjackers, causing a minor dent in the rear fender and hood of the trunk. A small hole was also created, big enough for Mary to slightly see out of, enabling her to witness the shooting of her would-be kidnapper Bad Bob!
She later discovers that her purse was thrown into the trunk along with her body, and in the purse was her cellular phone and its dying battery.
Marys life now relies upon her ability to recognize, through her small peep-hole, the various landscapes that fly by, as her car makes its way south.from Lakeport, in northern California, down through the Sierra Mountains, past the high deserts of Yucca Valley, and eventually, on to the Salton Sea and Calexico.
She has to describe her whereabouts to F.B.I. special agent, Mac McPherson, without the carjacker ever knowing that she exists. Horror fells her whole body as the days go by and she realizes that if she isnt able to lead Mac to her location, before the phone battery gives out or her car reaches the Mexican border she and her cell phone.would both be found dead." />
