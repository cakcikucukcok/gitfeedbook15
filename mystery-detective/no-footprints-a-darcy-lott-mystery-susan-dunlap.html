  <title>No Footprints: A Darcy Lott Mystery - Susan Dunlap</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;What is death?&lt;/I&gt; Darcy Lott asks her Zen teacher, Garson-roshi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While scouting a location site on the Golden Gate Bridge, stunt double Darcy Lott sees a woman about to jump.  The woman fights, but Darcy manages to pull her back.  Before disappearing, the woman tells Darcy that by Thanksgiving she&amp;#8217;ll be dead.  Darcy has four days to find her and keep her from killing herself, but she has no idea who she is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Darcy tracks her to a dodgy San Francisco neighborhood, where she uncovers more perplexing facts. The woman ran a copy shop operating as a front for &amp;#147;the cockroach,&amp;#8221; the shady police boss of the neighborhood, lived in a cheap apartment above a bagpipe player, and spent very little money except on an expensive racing bike the week before.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile, there are problems with the movie production.  One of the producers, Macomber Dale, gets their permit revoked, causing them to redo an entire set-up, and then drives the stunt car off the Berkeley pier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The search leads Darcy to the last place a woman would ever bike to: the Top of the Mark on Nob Hill, to a swank charity reception at City Hall and finally to a place more terrifying than the cold Pacific.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
