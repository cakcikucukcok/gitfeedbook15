  <title>Dead Ringer - Sarah Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Orchestra practice hits the wrong chord when a fellow musician is found dead, and violinist (and now amateur sleuth) Midori Bishop finds herself investigating more than just a new concerto in Sarah Fox&amp;#39;s new cozy mystery, &lt;em&gt;Dead Ringer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midori Bishop&amp;#39;s life is hitting all the right notes. She has her dream job playing violin in the Point Grey Philharmonic Orchestra, and is embarking on a new relationship with the symphony&amp;#39;s hot maestro. But when Midori finds a cellist strangled to death during a rehearsal, the maestro soon becomes the number-one suspect and Midori his only supporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midori sets out to prove the maestro&amp;#39;s innocence, but soon discovers that he and many others have secrets they would rather keep hidden. For someone who was only a ringer&amp;#8212;a temporary member of the orchestra&amp;#8212;the dead cellist had certainly made a lot of enemies. And as the investigation takes Midori closer to the truth, the killer gears up for a grand finale&amp;#8212;with Midori as the intended victim.&lt;/p&gt;" />
