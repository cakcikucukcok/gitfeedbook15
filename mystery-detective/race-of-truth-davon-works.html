      <meta name="description" content="It was just another morning for New York City&#39;s private investigator Dan Race when his phone rings. On the other end of the line is Jeff Barclay, Race&#39;s boss, informing him of a new assignment.   Why does it seem like the cold weather makes people go mad? That&#39;s the question Race asks himself when he stares at what appears to be the gory scene of a murdered teenage girl. Most of the evidence is there, but there is just one problem: where is the body? The fact that you have a brutal scene displayed in front of you like Christmas decorations in an upper-middle class family&#39;s home sparks red flags for the PI. Now, he has to use his investigative skills to solve a case that grows more complicated by the moment. As the case draws on, Race will discover the twisted secrets that are tied into this girl&#39;s supposed death.    Secrets that people would kill to have it remain just that." />
