  <title>The Lost Witness - Robert Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With his novel &lt;i&gt;City of Fire&lt;/i&gt;, Robert Ellis debuted a dynamic new character in Los Angeles detective Lena Gamble, but also captured a vivid picture of the city of Los Angeles. Readers and critics made &lt;i&gt;City of Fire&lt;/i&gt; an instant phenomenon, as the book became a &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller and was named a top summer read by &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; magazine, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Lena Gamble is a cop held in disgrace by department higher-ups for the explosive way the Romeo case played out, though she&#39;s still hailed as a hero by her colleagues for catching the killer. For her punishment, she hasn&#39;t handled a real murder investigation in eight months. When the chief finally tosses her a case, she&#39;s thrilled until she gets a look at the scene and realizes he&#39;s probably setting her up to be exiled once and for all: The victim is unidentified, and there are no witnesses, and no leads. Just the body, chopped into pieces and dropped in a Dumpster--gruesome enough to ensure that once again the media will be following Lena&#39;s every move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Ellis delivers another high-speed, commercial, powerful read, featuring one of the most engaging and vibrant police characters on the shelf today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
