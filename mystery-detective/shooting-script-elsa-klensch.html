  <title>Shooting Script - Elsa Klensch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fresh from solving the murder of a fashion magnate&#39;s wife in &lt;i&gt;Live at 10:00, Dead at 10:15&lt;/i&gt;, TV newsmagazine producer Sonya Iverson returns in &lt;i&gt;Shooting Script&lt;/i&gt;, another luxurious thriller from Elsa Klensch.&lt;br&gt;Once again working on a &quot;puff piece,&quot; this time about the opening of a new luxury spa headed by the third and youngest wife of Errol Swanson, former head of Sonya&#39;s own network, Sonya decides to put her frustration to good use. She&#39;s an investigative reporter--so she&#39;ll investigate.&lt;br&gt;And there&#39;s plenty of dirt to dig. For one thing, the head honchos at the network all seem scared of Errol--even Donna Fuller, Sonya&#39;s boss and a crusading journalist, treads softly where Errol is concerned. Rumors claim that Donna and Errol had an affair, and Errol&#39;s made a heavy-handed pass at Sonya.&lt;br&gt;Then there are the wives. Wife #1, Joan, is eating herself to death and trying desperately to wrest control of her family toy business away from her supposedly retired ex-husband. Craig, her son with Errol, disappeared a decade ago and is presumed dead; his twin sister, Christy, is mentally and emotionally unstable and has been the family scapegoat for years.&lt;br&gt;Wife #2, Margot, is a successful fashion designer who still lives in fear of Errol&#39;s notoriously violent temper. He&#39;s got his hooks into her business too, and the loans are due. Margot brings a gun to the spa, to protect herself and her charming son, Tomas. Tomas, a budding fashion model, wants his father to accept him, but his homosexuality disgusts Errol, and the two men have never had a civil conversation. &lt;br&gt;Wife #3, Lara, seems to be full of love and human kindness. She&#39;s engineered a family reunion along with the spa opening in an attempt to reconcile her husband with his wives and children before her own baby is born. Learning of Errol&#39;s past cruelties, Lara does her best to soften her hard-headed husband, but his unusual sexual demands have begun to wear on her soul. Lara has secrets of her own,  a dark past that may soon be exposed.&lt;br&gt;Rounding out the family gathering are Errol&#39;s Aunt Tracey, who knows where the bodies are buried--perhaps literally--and Sonya&#39;s fellow reporter Frank O&#39;Neill, who has a deeply personal connection to Lara and who is preparing a book-length expose of Errol Swanson.&lt;br&gt;When Errol is found, shot to death while tied to the bed he and Lara shared, the morning after a family dinner marked by vituperation and violence, local police have an abundance of suspects. But Sonya is already several steps ahead of the official investigation. She&#39;s determined to find out who killed the mogul . . . and get her scoop on the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
