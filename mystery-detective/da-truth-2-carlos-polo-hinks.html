  <title>Da Truth 2 - Carlos Polo Hinks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tez is back at it again in the continuous battle of the street life. After surviving being shot, he now has a choice to make. He has every reason to get out of the game, but just as many to stay. His girl Lex and his daughter Precious are his heart. He will give anything to see them happy, including taking his chances of never coming home. Tez has to make sure that he eliminates any looming threats before he can exit the game. The clock is ticking, and the streets show no mercy. Tez has learned that a wise man knows when to get up and get out. A fool continues to roll the dice and take the chance of losing it all.
Sasha watched Tez kill her husband, but she knew that he did it for a good reason. She continues to play her position, but life is not life without a plan. She was surprised that Tez had not attempted to kill her yet. Now it was just a game of who got who first. Until that time, she planned to capitalize on the situation as much as she could.
J-bo, Psycho, DaDa, and Mizery still maintained their loyalty to Tez. They are a family, not by blood, but by truth. Yet, as in every family, issues occur and problems arise. What could cause a crack within the loyalty they found in each other? Would someone snitch, kill, or steal? You will soon know Da Truth 2!" />
