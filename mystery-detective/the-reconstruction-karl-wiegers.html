  <title>The Reconstruction - Karl Wiegers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When 34-year-old forensic sculptor Jessica Sanford of Portland, Oregon, completes a forensic facial reconstruction on unidentified remains found in a forest, she discovers that she has a shocking personal connection to the victim. Jessica is then driven to identify the victim, to confirm their relationship, and to deliver justice for her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopted as an infant, Jessica cleverly exploits connections with other adoptees and their families in her quest for&amp;nbsp; the victim&amp;rsquo;s identity. Once she understands her link to the victim, Jessica finds herself more immersed in this case than in anything she has done before. Those involved in the apparent homicide are still out there&amp;mdash;and Jessica intends to find them. Her relationships, her career, and her life are at risk as she strives to&amp;nbsp; reconstruct the victim&amp;rsquo;s last days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just about uncovering a crime and hunting the suspects, &lt;em&gt;The Reconstruction&lt;/em&gt; is also about a young woman&amp;rsquo;s search for her own identity. Though the reader knows from the outset who the victim is and who was involved with her death, Jessica does not. The reader accompanies Jessica as she applies all of her skills and all of her smarts to try to solve the mystery of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers who enjoy suspenseful mysteries, forensics procedurals, and mysteries featuring a strong female protagonist will find &lt;em&gt;The Reconstruction&lt;/em&gt; engrossing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
