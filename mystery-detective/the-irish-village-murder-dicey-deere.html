  <title>The Irish Village Murder - Dicey Deere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When American translator and sometime sleuth Torrey Tunet returns home to the Irish village of Ballynagh, she wants nothing more than to relax in front of a peat fire in her cottage.

What they find at Gwathney Hall, however, is not a warmly welcoming Auntie Megan: it&#39;s cold-blooded murder. Historian John Gwathney has been brutally shot in his own house, and the immediate suspect is none other than his housekeeper-the girl&#39;s aunt-Megan O&#39;Faolain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain that her friend Megan is not a killer-and unable to resist a good mystery-Torrey vows to track down the murderer herself.

Was it Gwathney&#39;s assistant, who stood to gain a great deal upon his mentor&#39;s death? Was it Owen Thorpe, whose castle Gwathney visited for mysterious purposes shortly before he was killed?
