  <title>The Good Sister - Diana Diamond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jennifer and Catherine-sisters who have inherited equal shares of power in Pegasus Satellite Services, one of the biggest communications empires in the world-could not be more different.  While Catherine is an extraordinary beauty whose looks attract the most handsome and powerful men, her sister is a plain-Jane, no-nonsense gal who prefers running the company to walking the red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jennifer&#39;s aversion to the spotlight becomes secondary after the successful launch of the Pegasus III satellite, her newest technological masterpiece.  The company needs someone to explain the revolutionary communications tool to potential clients and Jennifer is forced to make the awkward transition from playing scientist in the laboratory to playing hostess at the most lavish party in Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s where she meets Padraig, a major film star with enough Irish charm and celebrity cache to make the move to power producer.  But when he marries Jennifer, Catherine&#39;s protective instincts are triggered: is the playboy actor only after Jennifer&#39;s money and connections?  When Jennifer is almost killed in a car accident on her honeymoon, Catherine feels she must intervene in her sister&#39;s relationship.  But Jennifer begins to suspect that Catherine is jealous of the wallflower sister&#39;s new romance, and possibly of her power within the company.  Was the accident Catherine&#39;s murderous attempt to win complete control of Pegasus?  Suddenly, neither sister can trust the other in a game that has their love, fortune, and even their lives hanging in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What begins as a rivalry between sisters becomes a chilling novel of psychological suspense in which one sister find herself alone on a yacht at sea, forced to defend herself from a terrifying killer in league with her sister.  But which sister?&lt;/p&gt;" />
