Those girls were kept in captivity to examine on them a poisonous serum, which can change a human being into a beast. 
The eventful fiction will increase inquisitiveness in readers to finish the story in a single breath till the story comes to a sweet end.
The story for its charm, attraction and diversity in subject will lure the filmmakers." />
