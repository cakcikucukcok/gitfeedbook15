  <title>The Tin Collectors/The Viking Funeral - Stephen J. Cannell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s two Shane Scully novels in one from bestselling author Stephen J. Cannell:&lt;/i&gt; The Tin Collectors &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Viking Funeral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Detective Shane Scully&#39;s best friend, Jody Dean, committed suicide three years ago, then who did Shane just see for one fleeting moment on the Ventura Freeway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s convinced it was his former colleague. Or was his mind playing tricks? Shane&#39;s lover, Alexa Hamilton, herself a lauded LAPD officer, happens to think so. But Shane knows what he saw. And for a rogue cop with nothing left to lose, the search for Dean has become more than an investigation. It&#39;s become an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first clue to Dean&#39;s secret lifeand suspicious deathis murder. The victim is Dean&#39;s former commanding officer. The connection taps into a corrupt, high-level conspiracy among L.A.&#39;s finest that will put Shane and everyone he loves in harm&#39;s way. It will cut deep into the heart of betrayal and the meaning of friendship. And it will dare one cop already on the brink of madness to take on step further into darkness...&lt;/p&gt;" />
