  <title>Be Careful of What You Wish 4 - Barbara J. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A wish tossed out carelessly on the worst night in her life proves impossible to escape when a sista, Lindsey-Smith, a struggling songwriter, must confront a crushing childhood secret in order to end a sadistic serial killer&#39;s reign. She&#39;s lead into this fight for her life when seduced by an intuitive exotic Chicago homicide detective, Lieutenant Lake, who has hunted the monster for a year. He targets girls linked by a freakish tapestry that must be unraveled by those who wish to stop him.&lt;p&gt;
Only one person on earth can make that hell-of-a wish come true. Lindsey-Smith. She&#39;s got it like that because Satan made it so during his annual pursuit of his favorite drink, courageous souls with a dash of vanity on the rocks. It is Halloween, that one day of the year when earth spaces and hell&#39;s faces get horizontal in a parellel universe. Those caught on the rim are there by Satan&#39;s invitation to make a wish come true or die.&lt;p&gt;
While reading enjoy &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; and &quot;Jump On It&quot;, the first songs to accompany a novel and discover the name of the first female Olympic gold metalist." />
