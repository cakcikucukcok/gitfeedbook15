  <title>Tales of the Games Player - Kev Pickering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Games Player - so called by the Daily Mail because his modus operandi involves convincing whoever is the adult in charge to persuade the others, especially the children, that they are playing a game of robbers to keep them calm while he secures them and ransacks the house.  He is notorious, both feared for his robberies, and admired for the way those he visits come out unharmed, if bound and gagged in various ways.  But how did he earn this reputation.  Here, in his own words, he recalls those he has visited, from the very first mother and daughter to more recent ones, and how he learned his craft.  Along the way, he meets all manners of families, and recalls both the successes and the failures, as well as times he was surprised and surprised others - even to the extent of having his own fan club...  In these short vignettes, he finds love, and sadness, happiness and sadness - but always with a smile." />
