  <title>Secrets in the Woods - J.E. Smythe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emilia Long is an investigative reporter from New York City. After reading documents left for her by her adopted mother, Emilia learned that she was left abandoned as an infant at a Brooklyn hospital. The discovery led Emilia on a journey to find her birth mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The search took her from New York to a small town in North Caroline. Upon her arrival, she learned that her birth mother disappeared months before her birth and that the disappearance was linked to a murder. With the key suspect in her mother&amp;#39;s disappearance locked away in jail on unrelated charges and the townspeople, including the Sheriff, unwilling to help her, Emilia found herself at a dead end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the help of her adopted sister, her newly found uncle, and her boyfriend, Emilia embarked on a suspenseful journey to find out what happened to her birth mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an unimaginable twist of fate, Emilia discovered more than she bargained for. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Secrets are better left untold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
