  <title>Memoirs of a Broken Hearted Girl - L.D. Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For as long as she could remember, her life has always been in turmoil. With a drug abusing mother and an abusive step father, Sophie, an intelligent, pretty girl, has a desire to escape the hell that her life has become. She successfully hides her scars from the world, but keeps them close to her hardened heart. Trained by the best, Sophie has a short fuse and the skills of a trained killer. Often finding herself unable to tame the monster within, she is tempted by the dark side more times than she can count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunate circumstances occur in her life, which threaten to pull the darkness that she strives to keep buried deep inside to the surface. Once that darkness is freed, Sophie is unable to recapture it to lock it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatized by her abusive childhood, haunting memories fuel her inability to love. But soon, Sophie finds her inability to feel challenged when she meets an irresistible man that gives her a glimpse of what falling in love could mean for her life. Stunned by the amount of love that she feels for him, she is finally ready to open her heart and experience true love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Sophie, life never goes that smoothly for her. Her overbearing, overprotective stepfather has plans for her life that do not include her falling in love. The secrets from her past that she has been harboring have a horrifying hold on her and refuse to remove their grip from her life. Driven by love, lies and murder, she finds herself making decisions that could, in the end cause her to lose everything, when the past comes knocking on her door. She has choices to make. Choices that could either pull her towards love, or pull her deeper into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
