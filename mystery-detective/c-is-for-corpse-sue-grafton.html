  <title>&quot;C&quot; is for Corpse - Sue Grafton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You haven&#39;t read a thriller until you read #1 &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author Sue Grafton&#39;s novels with her unforgettable P.I. Kinsey Millhone... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;C&quot; is for Corpse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was young-maybe twenty or so-and he must once have been a good-looking kid. Kinsey could see that. But now his body was covered in scars, his face half-collapsed. It saddened Kinsey and made her curious. She could see he was in a lot of pain. But for three weeks, as Kinsey&#39;d watched him doggedly working out at the local gym, putting himself through a grueling exercise routine, he never spoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one Monday morning when there was no one else in the gym, Bobby Callahan approached her. His story was hard to credit: a murderous assault by a tailgating car on a lonely rural road, a roadside smash into a canyon 400 feet below, his Porsche a bare ruin, his best friend dead. The doctors had managed to put his body back together again-sort of. His mother&#39;s money had seen to that. What they couldn&#39;t fix was his mind, couldn&#39;t restore the huge chunks of memory wiped out by the crash. Bobby knew someone had tried to kill him, but he didn&#39;t know why. He knew he had the key to something that made him dangerous to the killer, but he didn&#39;t know what it was. And he sensed that someone was still out there, ready to pounce at the first sign his memory was coming back. He&#39;d been to the cops, but they&#39;d shrugged off his story. His family thought he had a screw loose. But he was scared-scared to death. He wanted to hire Kinsey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His case didn&#39;t have a whole lot going for it, but he was hard to resist: young, brave, hurt. She took him on. And three days later, Bobby Callahan was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinsey Millhone never welshed a deal. She&#39;d been hired to stop a killing. Now she&#39;d find the killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&lt;br&gt;&quot;B&quot; Is for Burglar&lt;br&gt;&quot;C&quot; Is for Corpse&lt;br&gt;&quot;D&quot; Is for Deadbeat&lt;br&gt;&quot;E&quot; Is for Evidence&lt;br&gt;&quot;F&quot; Is for Fugitive&lt;br&gt;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&lt;br&gt;&quot;H&quot; Is for Homicide&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is for Innocent&lt;br&gt;&quot;J&quot; Is for Judgment&lt;br&gt;&quot;K&quot; Is for Killer&lt;br&gt;&quot;L&quot; is for Lawless&lt;br&gt;&quot;M&quot; Is for Malice&lt;br&gt;&quot;N&quot; Is for Noose&lt;br&gt;&quot;O&quot; Is for Outlaw&lt;br&gt;&quot;P&quot; Is for Peril &lt;br&gt;&quot;Q&quot; Is for Quarry&lt;br&gt;&quot;R&quot; Is for Ricochet &lt;br&gt;&quot;S&quot; Is for Silence &lt;br&gt;&quot;T&quot; Is for Trespass&lt;br&gt;&quot;U&quot; Is for Undertow &lt;br&gt;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vengeance &lt;br&gt;&quot;W&quot; Is for Wasted &lt;br&gt;&quot;X&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
