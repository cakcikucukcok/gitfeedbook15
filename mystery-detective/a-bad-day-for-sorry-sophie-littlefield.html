  <title>A Bad Day for Sorry - Sophie Littlefield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winner of the Anthony Award for Best First Novel!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stella Hardesty dispatched her abusive husband with a wrench shortly before her fiftieth birthday. A few years later, she&#39;s so busy delivering home-style justice on her days off, helping other women deal with their own abusive husbands and boyfriends, that she barely has time to run her sewing shop in her rural Missouri hometown. Some men need more convincing than others, but it&#39;s usually nothing a little light bondage or old-fashioned whuppin&#39; can&#39;t fix. Since Stella works outside of the law, she&#39;s free to do whatever it takes to get the job done---as long as she keeps her distance from the handsome devil of a local sheriff, Goat Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young mother Chrissy Shaw asks Stella for help with her no-good husband, Roy Dean, it looks like an easy case. Until Roy Dean disappears with Chrissy&#39;s two-year-old son, Tucker. Stella quickly learns that Roy Dean was involved with some very scary men, as she tries to sort out who&#39;s hiding information and who&#39;s merely trying to kill her. It&#39;s going to take a hell of a fight to get the little boy back home to his mama, but if anyone can do it, it&#39;s Stella Hardesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Littlefield&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Bad Day for Sorry&lt;/i&gt; won an Anthony Award for Best First Novel and an RT Book Award for Best First Mystery. It was also shortlisted for Edgar, Barry, Crimespree, and Macavity Awards, and it was named to lists of the year&#39;s best mystery debuts by the &lt;i&gt;Chicago Sun-Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;South Florida Sun-Sentinel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
