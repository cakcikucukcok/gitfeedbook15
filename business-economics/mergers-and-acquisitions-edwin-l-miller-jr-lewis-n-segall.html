  <title>Mergers and Acquisitions - Edwin L. Miller, Jr., Lewis N. Segall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The legal, financial, and business primer to the M&amp;A process&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/i&gt; offers accessible step-by-step guidance through the M&amp;A process to provide the legal and financial background required to navigate these deals successfully. From the initial engagement letter to the final acquisition agreement, this book delves into the mechanics of the process from beginning to end, favoring practical advice and actionable steps over theoretical concepts. Coverage includes deal structure, corporate structuring considerations, tax issues, public companies, leveraged buyouts, troubled businesses and more, with a uniquely solution-oriented approach to the M&amp;A process. This updated second edition features new discussion on cross-border transactions and &quot;pseudo&quot; M&amp;A deals, and the companion websites provides checklists and sample forms to facilitate organization and follow-through. &lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions are complex, and problems can present themselves at each stage of the process; even if the deal doesn&#39;t fall through, you may still come out with less than you bargained for. This book is a multi-disciplinary primer for anyone navigating an M&amp;A, providing the legal, financial, and business advice that helps you swing the deal your way. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Understand the legal mechanics of an M&amp;A deal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Navigate the process with step-by-step guidance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Compare M&amp;A structures, and the rationale behind each&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Solve common issues and avoid transactional missteps&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you know what action to take when you receive an engagement letter, confidentiality agreement, or letter of intent? Do you know when to get the banker involved, and how? Simply assuming the everything will work out well guarantees that it will—for the other side. Don&#39;t leave your M&amp;A to chance; get the information and tools you need to get it done right. &lt;i&gt;Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/i&gt; guides you through the process step-by-step with expert insight and real-world advice." />
