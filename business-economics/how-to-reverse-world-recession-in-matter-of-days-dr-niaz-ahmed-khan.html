  <title>How to Reverse World Recession in Matter of Days - Dr. Niaz Ahmed Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="About the book
by Dr. Niaz Ahmed Khan F.R.C.S., PhD.
This book is specially meant to change the world order by removing poverty, debts of the state by collecting much more revenue than the annual budget without taxes within the shortest period of time of thirty days, reduce inflation, create industrial revolution, reduce the cost of living by at least half, start of interest free banking, kick start of ailing economies, end of terrorism eradication of drug abuse and improvement in the law and order situation. This seems to be an illusion but this has been proved mathematically and economically in the book and is based on hard facts which are incentive based and are acceptable to human nature. Tax and interest are the two worst enemies of mankind causing all these problems which every country is facing. By removing these two evils one can achieve all the above benefits within no time and this is the main object of the book. A new and innovative methodology has been applied theoretically on USA in this book with astonishing results proving all the above points beyond any doubt. Areward of 10 million dollar is being offered who can disprove these facts. With the result that even the poorest state will become self sufficient without foreign aid then naturally the role of IMF, World Bank and all the other lending agencies will come to an abrupt end hence it will not be an exaggeration to say that IMF has been hanged. One has to read this book to find out the real truth as it is going to become economic revolution of the century and this will change the economic system of the world which has been based upon interest and taxes. In the last fifty years no advancement has been made in the field of economics although every year there are thousands of PhDs awarded and there is at least one noble prize winner. None of their work has ever helped or eased the sufferings of mankind which in fact are the creation of the so called economic wizards. All the great economies of super powers are under greatest threats of debts today and they hire the top economists of the world whose job is to solve these problems but with their backward and out of date knowledge confuse these states by juggling the figure of three rates; Inflation rate, interest rate and the Exchange rate. In fact all these economic giants should rethink and open their minds to the changing world order and think of practical economics which will help the nations and not the theories which have no values to help anybody in the world." />
