  <title>Groupon, The Online Discount Phenomenon - 50Minutes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Find out how Groupon exploded around the world in just 50 minutes!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The online deal marketplace Groupon was founded in 2008 in response to ordinary citizens&#39; declining buying power during the global economic crisis. Its initial success was astounding: its early growth outstripped that of Google, Amazon and eBay, and its value reached $1 billion just 17 months after its creation. However, cracks soon began to show as partners complained of being forced into loss-marking contracts and investors deserted the company in droves, causing its share value to plummet. In response, Groupon has taken steps to reinvent itself through its new marketplace and direct purchasing options, leaving many onlookers uncertain but cautiously optimistic about the site&#39;s future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In 50 minutes you will:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;oFind out about Groupon&#39;s business model and astonishing early successes&lt;br&gt;oUnderstand the reasons for Groupon&#39;s decline and the steps taken to remedy it&lt;br&gt;oIdentify Groupon&#39;s competitors and the challenges facing the company in future&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABOUT 50MINUTES.COM | BUSINESS STORIES&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Business Stories series from the 50Minutes collection provides the tools to quickly understand the innovative companies that have shaped the modern business world.
