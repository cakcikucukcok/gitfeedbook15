  <title>Summary: Business Plans That Win $$$ - Stanley Rich and David Gumpert - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “BUSINESS PLANS THAT WIN $$$: Lessons from the MIT Enterprise Forum” by Stanley Rich &amp;amp; David Gumpert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Business Plans That Win $$$, Rich and Gumpert argue that preparing a business plan that appeals to investors sufficiently to have them reach for their checkbooks is one of the great challenges to building a successful business. Yet the process of developing a business plan also serves another important function – it forces business owners and entrepreneurs to focus on company excellence and profitability in the marketplace above all else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although investor decisions sometimes appear to defy logic and reason, there is order and structure in the way they analyze potential investment opportunities. The business plan is the starting point for all such discussions; opportunities to progress matters further. In essence, business plans have become the entry point to funding markets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key to winning funding with a business plan is to look at things from the potential investor’s perspective – and being able to make a viable case for the investment. If you want to learn how to do so, Business Plans That Wins $$$ is a perfect guide for you." />
