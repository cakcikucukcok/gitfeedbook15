  <title>Leading with Authenticity in Times of Transition - Kerry Bunker, Michael Wakefield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Organizations today are awash in change. Managing change requires leaders to focus simultaneously on managing the business and providing effective leadership to the people. More often than not, it is the focus on the people side that loses out. This book offers a framework for understanding the issues and competencies that contribute to effective leadership during times of change. Its purpose is to help leaders determine how to choose and move among a variety of managerial approaches--to help them see what&#39;s working, what&#39;s not working, and what&#39;s missing. In this way, leaders can more clearly assess their impact and learn how to meet the demands of both managing the business and leading the people." />
