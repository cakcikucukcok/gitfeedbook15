  <title>Managing Pension and Retirement Plans: A Guide for Employers, Administrators, and Other Fiduciaries - August J. Baker, Dennis E. Logue, Jack S. Rader</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the U.S. Population ages, retirement is becoming an increasingly important life stage.  Pension and retirement plans are crucial to the financial well-being of older citizens and key determinants of their standard of living. Many varieties of pension plans are currently offered, and employers have an interest in these plans because a good pension plan can help an employer attract, retain, and motivate a competent workforce.  In some cases, the employers financial health can depend significantly on the financial health of its pension plan.  When employers make decisions regarding pension and retirement plans, they are making decisions that have high stakes for both their employees and the employer itself.  Poor decisions can lead to intense scrutiny, sometimes by the media or in the courtroom.  Good pension decision making can provide a secure future for the employer and its employees. Managing Pension and Retirement Plans: A Guide for Employers, Administrators and Other Fiduciaries covers the essential financial issues surrounding pension plans.  It discusses investment policy and strategy, performance measurement, fiduciary responsibilities, and labor market issues, among other topics.  Anyone responsible for any aspect of pension plan management will profit from reading this book." />
