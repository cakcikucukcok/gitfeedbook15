  <title>Thank God It&#39;s Sunday! - O. Bernard Smalls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;In &lt;I&gt;Thank God It&#39;s Sunday&lt;/I&gt; Bernard Smalls delivers the good news that a serving heart is the key to prosperity. This uplifting parable-based on a true account of a wildly successful car dealership-shows that profit is the applause we get for taking care of our customers.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;-Ken Blanchard, co-author of &lt;I&gt;The One Minute Manager&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Raving Fans&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why read TGI Sunday?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard Smalls, a former professional drummer, started his customer service career washing cars in Alaska. &lt;I&gt;That&#39;s cold!&lt;/I&gt; Today as a corporate trainer he teaches in a fun, motivating way the &lt;I&gt;TGI Sunday&lt;/I&gt; principles of excellent customer service. Readers of &lt;I&gt;TGI Sunday&lt;/I&gt; are guaranteed to be motivated, inspired, entertained, and enlightened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;In &lt;/I&gt;Thank God It&#39;s Sunday&lt;I&gt;, Bernard Smalls delivers an awesome message of true customer service with a new level of excitement and passion. The principles in this book can be applied to any business old or new to help create customers for life! This book is a must read!&quot;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;-David Martin-New York Life Insurance Companies-Partner, Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;I found Bernard&#39;s book to provide some really great insight into sales and team building. Really a must read for any aspiring to reach their full potential in either sales or sales management.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;-William &quot;Bub&quot; Brill-New York Life Insurance Companies-Managing Partner, Greenville, South Carolina&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;I am a real fan of Bernard Smalls. Bernard is one of the most effective speakers I know. His excellent content and enthusiasm will inspire any audience. Bernard is a real winner.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;-Dr. Ken Blanchard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;So many books are related to special systems to make production and profits in a mechanized way that suits and empowers the corporation. This new book of O. Bernard Smalls focuses in on the only real way of having business permanence: the customer. It is the customer that keeps a business alive, it is the customer that creates employment and it is the customer that is the only way to make a profit. &#39;Wake up corporations and appreciate and thank God for the customer.&#39;&quot;&lt;/I&gt;
