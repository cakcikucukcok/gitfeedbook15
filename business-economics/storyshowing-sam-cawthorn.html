  <title>Storyshowing - Sam Cawthorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Take your audience on a journey to leave a more lasting impact&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Storyshowing&lt;/i&gt; is an instruction manual for making connections. Storytelling has been shown to be one of the most effective methods of persuasion, motivation and inspiration, yet the disconnect remains — you&#39;re still only &lt;i&gt;telling&lt;/i&gt;. To truly influence people, you need to go deeper than that — you need to &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; them your story. By inviting your audience in, you connect on a much deeper, more emotional level; you bypass the brain and connect at the root of what it means to be human, leaving a profound impact on their entire outlook. This book shows you how to transcend telling and start &lt;i&gt;showing&lt;/i&gt; your story, using an easy-to-follow framework you can start applying today. Unearth your own experiences, and bring your vulnerabilities out into the light; share your emotions and forge a path to true communication. Use images, body language and gestures as tools to build that indelible connection; then and only then will people &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; engage and transform their thinking. &lt;p&gt;No matter your message, the impact lies in the delivery. This insightful guide equips you with the tools and skills you need to start communicating like never before. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Share more powerful stories using a simple 5-step method&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build confidence, influence others and make a deeper connection&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be more persuasive in presentations, pitches, calls and talks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Transform the way people think by inviting them inside your story&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference between telling and showing is like the difference between a lecture and a play. It&#39;s the difference between giving information and taking the audience on a journey. The difference between a brochure and a test drive. &lt;i&gt;Storyshowing&lt;/i&gt; helps you level up your communication to leave a lasting, more profound impact." />
