  <title>War Front to Store Front: Americans Rebuilding Trust and Hope in Nations Under Fire - Paul Brinkley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the top-ranking official at the U.S. Department of Defense in charge of economic rebuilding, Brinkley and his organization of hundreds of business volunteers struggled against bureaucratic policies to revolutionize foreign aid by leveraging America&#39;s strength&amp;#8212;its private sector. In doing so, his team demonstrated success in the midst of failure, and created hundreds of thousands of jobs in areas long written off by the civilian bureaucracy as hopeless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Reporting directly to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Brinkley spent five years overseeing economic improvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The lessons learned in these two nations were soon extended into the war-torn nations of Pakistan, Rwanda, and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Brinkley, who worked under both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations, reveals why American foreign policy has left these nations in the Middle East and Africa disappointed, resentful, and suspicious of American intentions. Optimistic that America can deliver on its economic promise, Brinkley outlines in&lt;i&gt;&amp;#160;War Front to Store Front&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;the necessary changes in U.S. foreign policy if we want to rebuild and revitalize an economy under fire.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This engaging account details:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Fascinating insights of the inner workings of American government and its largest bureaucracy&amp;#8212;the U.S. Department of Defense&lt;/li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Vivid descriptions of a group of business leaders who sought to change how the Pentagon did business, and who wound up in a war zone, including a firsthand experience of a terrorist attack&lt;/li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Detailed account of the American business model for foreign development that can improve the lives of war-ravaged citizens, at far less cost than existing military and foreign aid programs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Insights into the transition of the Bush Administration to the Obama Administration, and its impact on foreign policy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Inside details on the real business climate in Iraq, before and after Saddam Hussein, as well as its political landscape&lt;/li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Detailed analysis of the future of Afghanistan, economically and politically, and how its democratic institutions struggle to gain a foothold&lt;/li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Comprehensive map to connect Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to the global economy, creating opportunity and reducing anti-Americanism&lt;/li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Thorough breakdown of lessons learned in the Middle East and U.S. efforts to translate them to African nations, including Rwanda and Sudan&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;" />
