  <title>The Art of the Mensch - Leonard S. Gaby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In &lt;I&gt;My Theory of Infinite Wealth&lt;/I&gt;, Len Gaby shares a lifetime of business experience and recounts how his decisions to follow &quot;roads less traveled&quot; resulted in the transition from impressionable employee to seasoned manager to corporate executive and to adventurous entrepreneur. With his wife Debbie, he built a business in which the service model was based upon what they believed were essential components...and ways they could differentiate and position their business.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Len recounts the challenges and obstacles he faced and what it took to not only overcome them but find the true lessons in adversity and obstacles. He shares interesting and valuable stories (peppered with sidebars that amusing and amazing) from a lifetime in retail sales operations and explains how those experiences and choices led to the launch of a business that catapulted Debbie into the spotlight as the face and voice of a new kind of &quot;retailer.&quot; They were decisions and strategies that would later attract the attention of one of the largest retailers in the country... a company that would eventually buy theirs and continue the work they pioneered related to customer experience, &quot;shopping&quot; environment, and building a team of employees and managers that plays to win.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And winning &amp;#151; in Len Gaby&#39;s world &amp;#151; was creating an experience that was so unique that it became the tipping point, the element that differentiated his company and its core values that positioned his company for a future he never imagined.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
