  <title>Basic Executive Management Tips - Gaster Sharpley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life has logical phases, and it is critical that a person develop in the profession or area of focus with natural progression. Some of the phases may be shorter based on how quick one grasp the primary concepts that make up the phase. At some point, a person will develop sufficient skills and experience to become a manager and then an executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic Executive Management Tips&lt;/em&gt; written by Gaster Sharpley explores the basic issues of an executive manager and documents obvious issues that need to be considered. Most people wish to be in control and also enjoy the benefits of being the boss; however, very few are willing to take responsibility and make the necessary sacrifices required. These sacrifices must include a balance between the various aspects of life that will see the executive as a complete person rather than a complete executive and a lesser human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As readers flip through the pages of this book, they may from time to time feel that the information contain herein is basic and plain; however, it will serve as a reminder to everyone that being an executive is a serious responsibility and at times involves decisions about other peoples lives. A successful executive is also made up of a range of issues that comes together, including the people one work with, the people one choose to work with, the board, the clients, and the service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Basic Executive Management Tips&lt;/em&gt;, Sharpley simply wants to impart a message to readers particularly executive managers that executives should not be considered successful only by way of their position but rather, it is because of the circumstances that goes within that position. Successful executives will always be those who are willing to assume responsibility and sacrifices not only for themselves but also for the good of those under their wings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
