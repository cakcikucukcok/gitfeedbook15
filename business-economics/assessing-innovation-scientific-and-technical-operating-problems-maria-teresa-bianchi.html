  <title>Assessing Innovation Scientific and technical operating problems - Maria Teresa Bianchi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At a time when the crisis thin profit margins and the spending capacity of workers, the recipe for the exit from this impasse is to invest in innovation. Economic reality, however, leads to a series of reflections: what is innovation and how do you rate the same. What problems, even in terms of stock performance, deal with businesses that innovate and, last but not least with what funds should be financed, bearing in mind that the same must fall within a framework of corporate social responsibility. In fact, innovation must be socially compatible to be effective. This paper analyzes the issues exposed, based on data of international research and offers an innovative model to assess and report social environmental investment funded through a process of self financing.
