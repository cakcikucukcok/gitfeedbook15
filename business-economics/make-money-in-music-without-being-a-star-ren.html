  <title>Make Money in Music Without Being a Star - Ren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT&lt;/strong&gt; need to be a star to Make Money in Music!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you heard right, but let&amp;rsquo;s say it again. Louder, just to make sure. &lt;strong&gt;YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE A STAR TO MAKE MONEY IN MUSIC!&lt;/strong&gt; The world is full of successful working musicians - a silent majority who make very good incomes having turned their passion into their day-job. And you can do it too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of books on making it in the music business sell a formulaic approach to becoming a star. They will explain the myths they say are preventing everyone from being the next big thing. They will offer you &amp;lsquo;secrets&amp;rsquo;, things &amp;lsquo;the pros&amp;rsquo; do to succeed beyond us mortals. They will claim to teach you how to reinvent yourself, correct past mistakes and become a star. If all that really worked, there would be a lot more stars in the world. This book tells you &lt;strong&gt;THE TRUTH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;NO SECRETS&lt;/strong&gt;. This book is packed with insights on being a modern musician, and ways the author has very successfully made money in music, despite not being a star. The many strategies to a serious income can be combined based on your interests, available time, current skills and experience. Always be prepared for and say YES to opportunity!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author has made money in music, and you can too - by using the methods in this book!
