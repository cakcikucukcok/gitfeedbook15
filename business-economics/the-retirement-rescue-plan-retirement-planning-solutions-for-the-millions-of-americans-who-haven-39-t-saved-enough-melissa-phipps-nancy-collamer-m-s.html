  <title>The Retirement Rescue Plan: Retirement Planning Solutions for the Millions of Americans Who Haven&#39;t Saved &quot;Enough&quot; - Melissa Phipps, Nancy Collamer, M.S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;...fresh, realistic, and comprehensive solutions for the millions of Americans who haven&#39;t saved enough for retirement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;mdash;NANCY COLLAMER, Public Speaker, Career Coach, and Author of &lt;em&gt;Second-Act Careers: 50+ Ways to Profit Your Passions During Semi-Retirement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When financial planning expert Melissa Phipps decided to quit her 9-to-5 and start her own business, she told herself, &quot;the time is now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t retirement, but it was the first step. Not long after, she found herself in the middle of a large and unanticipated financial dilemma. And in order to survive it, she had to make some major changes that ultimately came down to one thing: redefining retirement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Retirement Rescue Plan &lt;/em&gt;will prepare you for retirement in a way that takes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; into account&amp;mdash;allowing you to define &quot;retirement&quot; in a new, realistic, and exciting way. The goals are simple: work less, earn enough, and be happier than ever. Are you ready to get planning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess what makes you happy&amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt;it sounds obvious, but when was the last time you took an honest look at what you really wanted?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gain control of your finances &lt;/em&gt;by reviewing your savings, expenses and budget with sample worksheets and exercises&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generate ideas for continued earnings&lt;/em&gt; by considering your unique skills and interests; and find extra inspiration by reading real-life retirement success stories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ensure your security&lt;/em&gt; with five methods to avoid common retirement planning mistakes&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing compares to the joy and relief you will feel when you find your way from financial despair to a fulfilling future, as you start to enjoy retirement in a way that works for YOU.&lt;/p&gt;" />
