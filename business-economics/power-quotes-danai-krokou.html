  <title>Power Quotes - Danai Krokou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Would you fancy an intellectual vitamin mix that inspires and motivates you to greatness?  Much has changed in the past decades. Genuine wisdom, though, has not. My aim through this book is to offer you the best bits of the best minds.  I believe there is a quote for every situation or challenge life throws at us. Throughout human history, great leaders have used the power of words to transform our emotions, engage us in their causes, and shape the course of History. The quotes featured in this book are not your typical quotes. Thousands were evaluated and arranged by subject based on their relevance, originality, motivational power and depth of meaning. You will notice that certain quotes are a call to action while others an opportunity for contemplation. The book is divided into three main sections. Each section is introduced by personal theories on life, business and leadership. Theories I live and swear by. Power Quotes has been a great source of inspiration for me and helped change and shape my personal and professional life for the better. It is my hope that this book will have a similar impact on your life." />
