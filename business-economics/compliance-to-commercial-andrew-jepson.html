      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Accounting profession is in the middle of a significant change. No longer are accountants considered &amp;ldquo;number crunchers&amp;rdquo; who deliver compliance services as their key functional role. Gone are the days of tax returns and statutory accounts, as these key functions become commodotised and are becoming outsourced to shared services departments overseas and potentially become part of the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, more than ever, qualified accounting professionals are becoming a key resource to guide and influence an organisation, department or business unit. The individual trusted to assist with decision making, and provide strategic guidance and insight into the direction of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, accountants and emerging finance leaders need to get up to speed quickly with the nuances of an organisation and, how to best &amp;quot;add value&amp;quot; to their business and ensure they are able to communicate effectively with non-finance individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you effectively apply your technical knowledge? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What behaviours are needed to manage team members, non-finance individuals, and senior stakeholders? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the while staying true to the values of the accounting profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Compliance to Commercial&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; The QUIET approach to Finance Business Partnering is a disciplined framework supporting Finance Business Partnership. Developed through research taken from non-finance leaders and what they would like to see from their finance teams, this framework and approach is helping to unlock the secrets to adding value as a finance function.
