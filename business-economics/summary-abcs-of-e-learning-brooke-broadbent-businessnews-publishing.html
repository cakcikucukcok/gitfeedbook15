  <title>Summary: ABCs of e-Learning - Brooke Broadbent - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;ABCs OF E-LEARNING: Reaping the Benefits and Avoiding the Pitfalls&quot; by Brooke Broadbent.&lt;br&gt;With computers and Internet being so widely accessible, the digital space a perfect vehicle for cost-effective learning. Electronic learning, or e-Learning as it is known, has not been half as successful as it could be. Apart from its wide reach and cost effectiveness, it has many other benefits including its adaptable structure, its interactive nature, its flexibility, and most interestingly the fact that it is non-linear meaning participants can skip material or specify the order in which they learn, something that cannot be tailored in the classroom. Thanks to all these advantages, e-Learning is becoming increasingly popular, at all levels of education. &lt;br&gt;In this summary of ABCs Of E-Learning, Brooke Broadbent helps to dissect the different forms of e-Learning and explains how to plan and roll out successful e-Learning courses with solid, measurable results. &quot;…e-learning can enhance the bottom line by making an organization more productive, saving money, and providing learners more access to more training.&quot;" />
