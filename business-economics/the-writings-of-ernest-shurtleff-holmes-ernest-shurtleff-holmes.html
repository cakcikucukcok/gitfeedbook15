  <title>The Writings of Ernest Shurtleff Holmes - Ernest Shurtleff Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ernest Shurtleff Holmes was the founder of the Church of Religious Science. Religious Science, like many New Thought faiths, emphasizes positive thinking, influence of circumstances through mental processes, recognition of a creative energy source and of natural law. Holmes had an immense influence on New Age beliefs, particularly his core philosophy that we create our own reality. &#39;The Science of Mind&#39;: Here is the complete first edition of &#39;The Science of Mind&#39;. For the careful practitioner this is the preferred edition as later editions lacked the power and focus of this edition and were simply less readable. Here you will find six lessons and countless affirmations that will help you unlock the power of your mind and find higher truths. You wont find a guide to the science of the mind that is clearer and easier to use. With the power of right thinking you will find that a new, better world awaits you! &#39;Creative Mind and Success&#39;: &#39;Creative Mind and Success&#39; is a guide to mental wellness and success. Like &#39;The Science of Mind&#39;, this book focuses on how the power of positive thinking can better your life, but it has more of a focus on financial well-being. This book is clearly a precursor to &#39;Think and Grow Rich&#39; and &#39;The Secret&#39;. &#39;Creative Mind&#39;: In &#39;Creative Mind&#39;, Ernest Shurtleff Holmes explores what it means to be a human being and how we all can become better human beings. He explores the role of man and God/Higher Power and how they can be, or are, one. This book will help your feel more in tune with the greater forces of the universe and be the best you that you can be." />
