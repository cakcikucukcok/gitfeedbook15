  <title>Retire Without Money - Edgard Joel Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discover Why Quitting The Rat Race Can Be One of The Most Rewarding Experience of Your Life By Making Your Life Full!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Possibly the word retirement means different things to different individuals. If you mean by retirement a life of complete withdrawal from the world and no activity beyond a 24 hour day loafing, then you need read no further because I can&amp;#39;t help you.&lt;br /&gt;
The only manner in which to achieve this, so far as I know, is to inherit a sizable fortune and I doubt that the average reader of this book has done so. I might mention that such persons, who have retired in this manner, are seldom happy. I have met them all over the world, and they are seldom happy.&lt;br /&gt;
You can retire, whatever your age, if you wish. I did and I am not more than an average American. I had an average education and have no more than average intelligence. I don&amp;#39;t particularly have the &amp;quot;gift of gab&amp;quot; and am certainly not a slick article.&lt;br /&gt;
The acquiring of a lovely wife and children, brought home to me the necessity of a more settled existence than the one I had enjoyed so many years abroad. But I found no need of a return to a humdrum life and what amounts to slavery.&lt;br /&gt;
I am currently writing and selling books by mail and on the internet and make sufficient income to enjoy life here in our own country with a minimum of effort.&lt;br /&gt;
I plan to retire soon, in or near, Palm Springs, California &amp;mdash;a paradise in many respects. Perhaps I&amp;#39;ll will find myself in Mexico, Europe or the Far East at some point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One thing is certain, I will never come out of retirement. The Contents of this eBook:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why You Should Consider Retirement&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Where to Retire&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When to Retire&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Retiring on a Small Income&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;America&amp;#39;s Bargain Paradise&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;America&amp;#39;s Art Colonies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In Your Own Home Town&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And so much more...&lt;/li&gt;
