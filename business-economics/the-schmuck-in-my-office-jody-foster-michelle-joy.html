  <title>The Schmuck in My Office - Jody Foster, Michelle Joy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This is a timely must-read for managers and anyone who has ever had to deal with a difficult coworker; it addresses a ubiquitous problem in a proactive, positive manner that should get the desired results.&quot; -&lt;i&gt; Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone has a &quot;schmuck&quot; in their office---a difficult, disruptive person who upsets the workplace, confuses coworkers, and causes concern. It&#39;s hard to understand why schmucks act the way they do, but one thing is certain---they seem to come in all shapes and sizes. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Narcissus---the condescending attention-seeker who carelessly steps on everyone&#39;s toes&lt;br&gt; - The Flytrap---the bringer of chaos whose emotional instability causes an office maelstrom&lt;br&gt; - The Bean Counter---the orderly perfectionist who never gives up control, even when it&#39;s full-steam-ahead to disaster&lt;br&gt; - The Robot---the unreadable stone wall who just can&#39;t connect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sound like anyone you know? These are just a few of the more prominent types of difficult people at work. In &lt;i&gt;The Schmuck in My Office&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Jody Foster explains the entire spectrum of people we may think of as schmucks, how they can decrease productivity, destroy teams, and generally make everyone else unhappy. Along with nailing down the various types, she looks at personality traits and explains how dysfunctional interactions among coworkers can lead to workplace fiascos. She helps readers understand schmucks as people, figure out how to work with them, and ultimately solve workplace problems. She also makes readers consider the most difficult thing of all: despite where your finger may be pointing, sometimes &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the &quot;schmuck&quot;! Let Dr. Foster teach you how to make your workplace a happier and more productive one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
