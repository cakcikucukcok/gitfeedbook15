  <title>Reinventing Dell: The Innovation Imperative - Heather Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Knowing that an asteroid is going to hit the earth is not really useful if you are not planning to launch missiles to knock it out of the sky. You have to work massively overtime on the belief that innovation or massive change is going to happen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Tom Martin, former VP of marketing&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dell was once listed by Fortune as the most admired company in the world, and held the #1 market share in personal computing. Between 1991 and 1999, Dell&amp;rsquo;s stock price outperformed that of its next closest competitor by a factor of 20 times - only to lose 70 percent of its value by 2009. &lt;em&gt;Reinventing Dell&lt;/em&gt; is the inside story of one of tech&amp;rsquo;s most intriguing giants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this essential new text, innovation expert Heather Simmons asks: How did Dell go from one of the most admired companies in the world to a firm whose stock flatlined for the better part of a decade? More importantly, how might it come back?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reinventing Dell&lt;/em&gt; turns Dell&amp;rsquo;s rise, fall, and emergent return into cogent lessons that business leaders can&amp;rsquo;t do without.
