  <title>Career Diplomacy - Harry W. Kopp, John K. Naland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Career Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; is an insider&#39;s guide to the Foreign Service as an institution, a profession, and a career.  In this thoroughly revised third edition, Kopp and Naland provide an up-to-date, authoritative, and candid account of the life and work of professional US diplomats, who advance and protect this country’s national security interests around the globe.
