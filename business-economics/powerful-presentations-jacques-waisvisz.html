  <title>Powerful Presentations - Jacques Waisvisz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Special Feature: This book offers eight unique self-evaluating exercises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many books have been written on the subject of public speaking.  Often these voluminous books have been composed with the aspiring professional speaker in mind.  However, most people do not want to become professional speakers.  They just want to be able to address an audience, when required, and to deliver a presentation with grace, humour and confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But most people are afraid! A study conducted by Reader&amp;#39;s Digest and Yale University has, for twelve years in a row, concluded that the number one fear amongst 75 per cent of North Americans is the fear of speaking in front of a group of people. Why do we have this fear of speaking in public?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Powerful Presentations&amp;quot; answers that question and suggests ways to overcome that fear.   The book takes the reader through eight easy steps to write a presentation and eight secrets to present with power and confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This practical book on public speaking  will help students, managers,  executives and, in fact, everyone to communicate with an audience in a competent  manner." />
