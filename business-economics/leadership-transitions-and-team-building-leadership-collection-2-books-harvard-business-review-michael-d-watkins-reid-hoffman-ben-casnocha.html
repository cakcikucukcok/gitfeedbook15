  <title>Leadership Transitions and Team Building: Leadership Collection (2 Books) - Harvard Business Review, Michael D. Watkins, Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Leadership Transitions and Team Building Collection includes two important books: &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The First 90 Days, Updated and Expanded&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, by Michael D. Watkins, and &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Alliance&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, by Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, and Chris Yeh. Transitions are a critical time for leaders. In fact, most agree that moving into a new role is the biggest challenge a manager will face. While transitions offer a chance to start fresh and make needed changes in an organization, they also place leaders in a position of acute vulnerability. Missteps made during the crucial first three months in a new role can jeopardize or even derail your success. In &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The First 90 Days&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, Watkins offers proven strategies for conquering the challenges of transitions&amp;#151;no matter where you are in your career. &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Alliance&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, coauthored by the founder of LinkedIn, introduces a new, realistic loyalty pact between employer and employee. The employer-employee relationship is broken, and managers face a seemingly impossible dilemma: the old model of guaranteed long-term employment no longer works in a business environment defined by continuous change, but neither does a system in which every employee acts like a free agent. The solution? Stop thinking of employees as either family or as free agents. Think of them instead as allies. This bold but practical guide for managers and executives will give you the tools you need to recruit, manage, and retain the kind of employees who will make your company thrive in today&amp;#8217;s world of constant innovation and fast-paced change.&lt;/div&gt;" />
