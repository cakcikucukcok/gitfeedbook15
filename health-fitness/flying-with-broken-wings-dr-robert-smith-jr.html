  <title>Flying with Broken Wings - Dr. Robert Smith Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in a world of broken people burdened by the pain of unresolved conflicts, mourning unrealized dreams. It matters not if youre African American, Hispanic, a person of color from the Caribbean or elsewhere in the world, Asian, White, single, married, affluent, whether you live on a fixed income, reside in an upscale hamlet or community plagued by social and economic neglect. It matters not if you were raised by a single mother or father, or achieved academic success or failed to complete the tenth grade. So many brothers and sisters are among the walking wounded. Men and women tortured, traumatized by past and present events in their lives that have cast a dark shadow over their sense of internal security and healthy perspective on who they are as human beings. 
My thesis is this: every person, regardless of the circumstances of his or her life, has value and worth. Simply stated, you are somebody because of your uniqueness. Every human being has talents, special abilities, and temperament that benefit a community, family, or society.
This book is not aimed specifically at faith communities, whether Christian, Jewish, or disciples of Islam, though on a visceral level, I hope my words touch brothers and sisters trying to fit into a group to lift their self-image, brothers and sisters who heard negativity in the voices of their childhood repeated ad nauseam: You are nothing. Youre not as smart as your brother or sister." />
