  <title>The Fall in Love Process: Body Program - Dr. Lauren Sierra Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Fall In Love Process: Body Program (Book One in The Fall In Love Process Series) helps you identify and let go of the current body paradigm that keeps you feeling anxious and insecure about your body. It provides the missing link as to why diet and exercise programs tend to fail in the long-term. The Body Program is a unique process that provides a real foundation for change. 
Everything you want in your life is because you believe in the having of it you will feel good. The Fall In Love Process helps you learn how to feel good. Isnt that the real prize you are seeking? 
The Fall In Love Process includes 3 core programs that show you how to manage and feel great in the following areas: 
Loving Your Body (Body Program) 
Loving Yourself/Loving Relationships (Relationship Program) 
Loving Separation: A Window Of Opportunity for Personal Transformation (Break-Up Program) 
No program or process will make your life perfect. Think about The Fall In Love Process like this: If you can feel significantly better about your body, yourself, and your love relationships, isnt that a ride worth taking? 
Welcome to The Body Program and The Fall In Love Process. 
After finishing reading your amazing book, I feel so enriched by your program. Its such a sensible, holistic approach which is generating more self-love and spilling out to my loved ones too. Reading your book opened doors for me, even though Ive read shelves of self-help books in my time. When the student is ready, the master appears. With so many thanks. -Lisa Marie, MA 
Your program has changed not only how I feel about my body. My whole life has improved. I have a whole new perspective and feel better about myself. I have fallen in love with my body - and my life. Your program is awesome! 
-Mary, CA 
The Fall In Love Series consists of programs Dr.  Thomas has developed as a result of personal life  experiences.
