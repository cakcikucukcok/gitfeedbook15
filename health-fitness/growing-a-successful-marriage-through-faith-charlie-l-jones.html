  <title>Growing a Successful Marriage Through Faith - Charlie L. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing a Successful Marriage through Faith tells the story of marriage. The book has many facets; first, it describes the institution of marriage as it was meant to be, between a man and a woman. It tells of their relationship with the Creator, which is the bond that holds the marriage together. Second, it tells of choices made by a man and a woman that break the marriage bond. Finally, it is a story about grace and redemption, which is a free gift offered by God (through faith) to restore the bond. I refer to this book as a marriage-faith help book, a book to assist couples to protect their marriage vows, as well as to cultivate their marriage in producing the fruit of the Spirit. Refining a marriage through faith requires not only having a personal relationship with God and allowing him to guide ones decision making but also being obedient to Gods instructions. Growing a Successful Marriage through Faith not only represents an individual spiritual journey, in which God redeems a person through a personal relationship with him, but it also represents a spiritual marital journey where God redeems the marriage and restores the marriage bond through the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit bonds a marriage together, the marriage is in a state of holy matrimony. The book Growing a Successful Marriage through Faith tells of my personal life story, and possibly, there are parts of the story that others may be able to relate to. I think this book is unique in that it combines a life situation caused by personal choices with what the Bible says about the situation then reinforces the lesson through the essence of visuals in nature. In this case, the visuals are photographs of an okra plant that grew between the blocks of concrete. Questions are presented to the reader throughout the text not only to engage the reader but also to reinforce that the solutions to relationship issues require self-examination and spiritual solution. The answers that you give may be reflections of your problem-solving approach, whether spiritual or otherwise. In the Bible, Jesus often used parables that involved nature, and he performed miracles. Both mediums were used to grow faith. The book also serves to encourage those who are going through personal trials in their lives, whether marriage, health problems, or any other difficult life circumstance, to study the Word of God and pray that God sends the Holy Spirit to move in their lives. When your relationship with God becomes close-up and personal, he gives you spiritual discernment (that is, the wisdom to put your lifes circumstances in their proper perspective), and he gives you inner peace." />
