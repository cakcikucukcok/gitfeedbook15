Resilient
John T. Sully was always content with living his life on his own. Without knowing it, Sully had waited his whole life to find this girl. His friends had been the only people he had been willing to kill for, until he met Alexa. What happens when life takes her away from him? With the help of boys, Sully finds out how far he is willing to go, but is it worth also risking the lives of his friends?
&quot;This was a real pleasure to read. He has a natural storyteller&#39;s swagger about him, and really kept the plot moving.&quot;
