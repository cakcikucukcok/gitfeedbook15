  <title>The Cancer Revolution - Leigh Erin Connealy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;When it comes to cancer, conventional doctors are trained to treat their  patients exclusively with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. These  methods are grueling on the whole body - and they don&#39;t treat beyond the  tumor or the cancer itself. The focus is on the &lt;i&gt;disease&lt;/i&gt;, not the whole person - and because of this, the outcomes in conventional medicine can be bleak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But  it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. Dr. Leigh Erin Connealy has developed a  whole-person approach to treating cancer - and these treatments have  helped thousands of patients through her Cancer Center for Healing. In &lt;i&gt;The Cancer Revolution, &lt;/i&gt;Dr.  Connealy shows you how to get to the root causes of cancer and the  practical steps you can take to get back on the path to healing - from  balancing your body&#39;s chemistry with nutritional supplements, following a  healthy food plan, detoxifying your body and home, exercising  regularly, getting deep restful sleep every night, practicing stress  reduction techniques, and putting together a supportive healing team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chemotherapy  and radiation have their place in treatment, but in many cases, they  are simply not enough, because cancer isn&#39;t caused by one thing, but by  many different factors. All of these causes must be addressed, not just  the tumor. &lt;i&gt;The Cancer Revolution&lt;/i&gt; will equip you to make  impactful, achievable lifestyle choices that fight the root of the  disease, and that offer hope for recovery and a cancer-free life.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
