  <title>The Nutrition Revolution - Frank Laporte-Adamski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frank Laporte-Adamski, naturopath, osteopath, “Heilpraktiker”, and the creator of a nutrition regulation that runs the body better by improving health and fitness, still insists after fifteen years that “we must have a clean digestive tract in order to live longer and be in better shape”.For years Laporte-Adamski has promoted the consumption of acidic fruits, vegetable oils, and virgin olive oil from its first cold pressing, recognized today as anti-malady foods. Recent scientific discoveries show that the belly is our second brain: our immune defenses are found therein, and so it is vital not to clog the digestive organs. The foundation of our nutrition, health and longevity is the digestive tract itself, and Frank Laporte-Adamski is here to reveal how it works.The Nutrition Revolution is an important book, the result of many years of practice and hundreds of resolved cases, intended for all those who have their psychological and physical wellbeing at heart and that desire to find an explanation and a concrete solution to many problems such as back pain, headaches, insomnia, fatigue, heavy legs, infections, skin and circulatory problems, and so on." />
