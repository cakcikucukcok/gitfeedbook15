  <title>The Values of Working in the Alberta Oil Sands - Matthew E. McLaren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an open house that will allow the world to view my experience working in the Alberta oil sand industry. I am a retired senior, who has been working in this phenomenal industry for many years and who has seen and experienced the technological changes that have been engineered to provide a safer and more productive environment for the exploration of Northern Alberta buried treasure. Distribution of wealth is a loaded statement in our democratic society. In the Alberta oil sand, I can safely use this statement because I have experienced the distribution of wealth in this remarkable industry.
Oil sand companies are developing the oil sand industry, providing opportunity, where seniors like me and others, can become a member of the industries working family and share in the distribution of health and wealth. Equal opportunity does not mean equal pay. However, we are all given the opportunity to work and share in the development and distribution of this industrys most valuable buried treasure." />
