  <title>Nowhere Is Home ... Since You Left - Madeleine Zeldin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When her beloved soul friend husband, Gerald, passed away a few years ago, and her friends and sons moved to distant cities, she found herself alone for the first time in her life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gerald, a professional artist, had his studio in their home. Their home was always filled with family life, art, music, joy and playfulness in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;
After his passing, the silence was loud. The joy was gone &amp;mdash; her paradise &amp;mdash; a lost paradise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She had two choices, either to fall apart or to get on with life.&amp;nbsp; She chose the latter and traveled to find a home, a community &amp;mdash; however - nowhere was home - since he left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing Nowhere Is Home &amp;hellip; Since You Left, Madeleine Zeldin shares her insights, emotions, and true life experiences as she journeys solo throughout the years following the sorrowful death of her soul mate, internationally renowned artist, Gerald Zeldin. She presents years of storytelling based on travel journals she wrote while traveling to countries such as Mexico, Philippines, Ecuador, France, Spain, and California, U.S.A.&amp;nbsp; Zeldin also reveals the intensity of the pain and sorrow experienced in her grief, along with the fulfillment, satisfaction and logistics of international travel. In her travels she volunteered in the medical ?eld and gave help where help was needed. She brings inspiration to those of her generation, the 60&amp;rsquo;s, who find themselves alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through her evocative tales of adventure, Zeldin reveals this life-changing knowledge to the world!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But ultimately where is Home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionally, Ms. Zeldin has been engaged in nursing and teaching. She has successfully advocated for changes in the medical field, along with homebirth and midwifery. In her travels to out of the way places, she has been a keen observer of people and distant cultures, often writing a &amp;#39;sketch&amp;#39; of her experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
