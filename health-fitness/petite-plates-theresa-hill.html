  <title>Petite Plates - Theresa Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You will not find a person who cares more about the health and nutrition of everyone more than Theresa Hill. Her recipes are delicious and enjoyed by not only myself, but our viewers as well. Make as many of them as you can! (Kathryn Ghion, reporter, WBOY 12 News) 
Dr. Akkary and Akkary Surgery Center have supported Theresa Hill and her cookbooks for several years. Her passion and loving encouragement toward health and wellness is inspirational to Dr. Akkary. This passion and her first cookbook, Treenies Beginning, was the start of their work relationship. Theresa has been active at Akkary Surgery Center as a nutritionist teaching diet classes to Dr. Akkarys patients since late 2015. Her style of teaching and experience with cooking creatively has inspired patients to branch out and learn new ways to incorporate herbs, greens, and other healthy presentations to their family tables. In addition to her expanding cookbook collection, Theresa has a growing nutrition business, Eat Well. Patients and community residence come to her for guidance toward fresh ideas and flavorful recipes to spice up their kitchen and lifes relationship with food. She makes appearances throughout North Central WV, sharing her experience and knowledge as a chef, a writer, and a nutritionist. These qualities and accomplishments are just a few reasons why Dr. Akkary and Akkary Surgery Center support Theresa and all of her flourishing aspirations. (Dr. Akkary and all the staff at Akkary Surgery Center) 
Theresa is a fantastic cook! She prepares nutritious meals for our family of four every week. Everything is very flavorful and very real. Nothing processed or artificial coming from her. From the fruit salad and bean dips to the marinades and frittatas she makes, we couldnt be happier with the balanced, healthy meals she prepares. She can take just about anything and make it taste good. And the kids love it too! We cant wait to see what she comes up with next! (Caroline G. Labritz, DDS)" />
