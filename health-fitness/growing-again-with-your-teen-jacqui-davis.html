  <title>Growing Again with your Teen - Jacqui Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If raising a teenager is something you would like to give your best to , then this book is for you. The book covers topics you should pay attention to while raising your teenager in the 21st Century;&amp;nbsp; ranging from hormones, good and bad of technology, stress, respect, dating and sex to bullying and money management. &amp;nbsp;These are the most exciting years of a child&amp;rsquo;s life and that makes it all the more important that we give enough time and thought to doing our best for them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Growing Again with your Teen&amp;rdquo; will help you see a teenager&amp;rsquo;s life through their eyes. In the process, you will become better equipped in using the wisdom and maturity that comes with age. It is my belief that the contents of this book will ensure that both you and your teenager grow together through it all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every child deserves the best &amp;mdash;and by &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo;, I mean their own very best. &amp;ldquo;Growing Again with your Teen&amp;rdquo; will help you make that happen." />
