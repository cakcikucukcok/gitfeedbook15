  <title>101 Questions and Answers About Hypertension - William M. Manger, Norman M. Kaplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Hypertension, or high blood pressure, affects an estimated 50 million Americans and is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.  Through proper management the effects of hypertension can be minimized. Dr. William Manger&#39;s &lt;I&gt;101 Questions &amp; Answers About Hypertension&lt;/I&gt; is a comprehensive Q&amp;A format book providing the reader all the information they need to help manage hypertension and prevent its often lethal effects.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;101 Questions &amp; Answers About Hypertension&lt;/I&gt; answers all the most important questions about hypertension and its relationship to other diseases, from hypothyroidism and Alzheimer&#39;s to arteriosclerosis and preeclampsia, among others. It also has suggestions for positive lifestyle changes as well as information on alternative and traditional treatment options and questions related to change of life and the effectiveness of blood pressure machines in pharmacies, shopping malls, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Question 8 addresses the enormous magnitude of hypertension in the United States.  Hypertension is a precursor to stroke and cardiovascular disease.  Cardiovascular disease kills nearly 1 million Americans every year and cripples and disables the same; it&#39;s also responsible for more than 52 million lost workdays. In addition, every year more than one-million people suffer heart attacks and 600,000 suffer strokes, a large percentage of both proving fatal.  However, Dr. Manger is convinced these statistics can be reduced.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inspired by the decrease in the incidence of heart attack and stroke, Manger saw that with improved medical management and healthy lifestyle changes, hypertension could be controlled and its complications minimized or prevented.  He believes a close patient-doctor relationship and a clear understanding of what hypertension is and how to manage it is essential for bringing it under control and minimizing the risk of further health complications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even though Manger is positive overall about statistics, still there is room for improvement: nearly 30% of people suffering from hypertension go undiagnosed and only 27% of the 50 million people with this condition have their blood pressure under control. &lt;I&gt;101 Questions &amp; Answers About Hypertension&lt;/I&gt; seeks to reduce the statistical gap by giving readers a comprehensive understanding of hypertension so they are able to knowledgeably communicate with their doctors and make informed decisions and choices to improve their health and reduce health risk.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;" />
