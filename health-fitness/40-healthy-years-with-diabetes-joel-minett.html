  <title>40 Healthy Years with Diabetes - Joel Minett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have lived forty healthy years with Type 1 diabetes. I wrote this book to let other diabetics know how to live that many years with this deadly disease and be very healthy. I have never had surgery, never had kidney, heart, eye or circulation problems. If I cut my foot it heals like everyone elses. I have perfect 20/20 vision. I was an eight year old boy when I became diabetic. Forty years ago the life expectancy wasnt very good for someone with diabetes. There were other young children from my area that became diabetic about the same time that I did. They have all died. In this book I will tell you how I lived my life differently than those other young children. The reasons why I have been this healthy will surprise you. I wont tell you to go on some crazy diet or anything like that. I will just give you some common sense things that I have done my whole life to stay this healthy with diabetes. I have taken over 36,000 injections of insulin in forty years. I wrote this book to inspire other diabetics or parents of a diabetic child. Diabetes does not have to change your life; it has never stopped me from doing anything." />
