  <title>Serenity for Leaders - E.D. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As leaders we have to constantly step up the plate.   Seems there are always fires to put out. There is always customer service that could have used more care in packing fragile items so they do not break in transit. A computer installation that isnt completed satisfactorily so it needs redoing all over againwhile losing more person hours in the process. 
Situations similar to this can keep me running on empty for long hours. Make me lose my cool. Feel bumped out. These are all less than positive situations and vibes that keep a person down. 
Something happened; however, as I kept thinking about staying focused and productive with team building so team members would enjoy working together. We need to make WORK an appealing lifestyle condition so people like coming to work.  It is a known fact that we spend at least one-third of our lives with our co-workers. 
Therefore, Im motivated to write another book on Serenity. My first book, Serenity: 30 Days to Rebalance Body-Mind-Spirit, inspires readers to meditate for self-enrichment, enjoy quiet time and rediscover their true potential from their inner source of, Serenity.
This book, Serenity for Leaders: 30 Days to Honing True Leadership, is aimed at leaders of all stripespastors, military rank, corporate executives, school teachers, nursing staff managers, government agency supervisors, small business ownersanyone looking to develop a strong inner foundation based on serenity, poise and inner peace. 
Any reader interested in human relationships will find this book helpful for day-to-day living. Learning and mastering leadership skills are not only for appointed leaders. More significantly, leadership skills translate to self-mastery in understanding self and othersand is key to enhancing a quality work-life balance." />
