  <title>Mind - Body - God Connection - Darlene Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is there a connection between what we think and how we feel? Does the mind talk to the body and the body to the mind? What about negative childhood experiences? Can early life experiences impact the state of our physical, mental, and emotional health decades later? The exciting field of psychoneuroimmunology explores the vital links between the mind and body and their roles in the development of disease. Current research demonstrates that our state of health has more to do with our state of mind than we had earlier believed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a registered nurse with over 25 years of experience, Darlene D. Hall has worked in a variety of settings. She has encountered thousands of patients in both medical and psychiatric settings and has seen firsthand the links between the mind, the body, and the development of disease. She also has had the unique experience of not only being a nurse, but also a patient who has suffered from a variety of illnesses, beginning early in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her book, Mind-Body-God Connection, Darlene writes from her experiences as a nurse and from a personal perspective. In this book she connects the dots that lead to disease and shares how she found healing&amp;mdash;mind, body, and spirit." />
