  <title>Finding Your Life Partner Without Tears - Emmanuel Abba Great</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finding a suitable life partner is one of the biggest huddles of life. Destined great men and women have been destroyed because of wrong marriages. &lt;bR&gt;
&lt;bR&gt;
There is a saying that, Beside every successful man, there is a woman and I add Beside every successful woman, there is a man.
&lt;bR&gt;
If the success of everyone depends to a great extent on the strength of his or her marriage, then this book is a must read for all. 
&lt;br&gt;
Many great empires have been reduced to rubbles because of the abuse of this wonderful institution that God puts in place to make the life of people heaven on earth. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Relationships and marriage are like water to life: That means, it is a subject that cuts across culture, tradition and race. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book deals with finding a life partner Gods way; and I believe, it is the only way that works." />
