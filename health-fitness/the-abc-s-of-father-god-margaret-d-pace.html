  <title>The Abc’S of Father God - Margaret D. Pace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Family Devotional Guide was prepared to bring awareness to the Body of Christ as a more excellent way of worship unto the Lord. As believers it is our purpose to worship the Lord and we must begin to know Father God in a more excellent way. So many times, I hear people talk about God as though He is so far away like a far distant cousin they have - but rarely ever see or talk to. We often claim to know God, but not in a more intimate way as we should and could, so we simply only know about him. Our intimacy begins with our conversations with our Father. We must know that prayer is our communication, our communing with Daddy God. It is our acknowledgment of our Creator, our Master. As His children begin to acknowledge and speak of His many character qualities, dimensions, and attributes, this will depict the vast Excellencies of his matchless names and marvelous works. We will then begin to develop an intimate relationship with Abba Father to speak well of Him in our devotion times. As we draw nigh to Daddy God, He will draw nigh to us (James 4:8)." />
