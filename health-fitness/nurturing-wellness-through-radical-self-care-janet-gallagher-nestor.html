  <title>Nurturing Wellness Through Radical Self-Care - Janet Gallagher Nestor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A necessity for 21st century living. A practical means for daily balancing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Indrani Maity, ND, D.Ay., &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrated Ayurvedic Naturopathic Energy Medicine Center &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurturing Wellness through Radical Self-Care: A Living in Balance Workbook guides the reader not only to emotional and physical healing, but also to lasting emotional well-being. Mental health professionals will find this complete mindfulness-based program valuable to create a well-planned and flexible holistic approach to client care. The book also gives individuals self-help tools to participate in their own recovery and achieve lasting wellness from the comfort of home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few wise women I know, and Janet is one of them. She is one truly gifted in matters of the heart. Her new book, Nurturing Wellness through Radical Self-Care, is a fitting follow-up to Pathways to Wholeness. Janet manages to embrace a complex field with a gentleness that makes the material accessible and eminently useful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me so long to learn how to find joy, this book gives people easy to follow plans to quickly harmonize all the systems in their body and find not only joy but peace and health. I feel the major benefit is the programs ability to help lift anyone out of the fight or flight response into a more positive balance and mindset. Thank you, Janet, for this gift. Ill be recommending this to the parents I work with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janets many years of experience working with clients as a therapist plus her in-office research and extensive studies make her a perfect guide and teacher if you are looking for ways to improve your life. The text a is timely gift to humanity!&lt;/p&gt;
