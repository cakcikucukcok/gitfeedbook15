  <title>It Occurred to Me - Carol Swarbrick Dries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;IT OCCURRED TO ME (A Guide to a Happy Self) is an easy read and an easy guide to alter your attitudes about your place in this world.  The point is made in different (sometimes amusing, sometimes touching, and sometimes tough) ways that we all have a place in this universe and we are at that right place - right now.  Through the journey of these essays, you can find simple solutions to everyday misconceptions and challenges.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;We all have had some flawed concepts presented to us about ourselves and about our impact on others.  Heres a sort of Treasure Map out of depression and self-doubt.  The author shares some very personal stories about how her map got smeared, folded and mutilated, and then, how she has been able to straighten out the wrinkles and decipher her path.  The next step or turn is continually revealed, so long as one is ready and willing to take it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The thoughts and ideas expressed in these essays can help anyone out of their self-esteem deficit. Because they are simply stated, they are profound in their universal benefits.  Try to look for similarities in your own heart, in your own experiences. Have you felt the same way the author has felt about these issues? Can you see a way out? Keep reading and thinking and feeling.  Open your mind to change.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the conclusion of the book, there is a Certificate of Sufficiency (suitable for framing!)  Write your name on it and keep it where you can see it. You are ENOUGH, right where you are  just because you are.&lt;/P&gt;" />
