  <title>40 Plus Homemade Body Butter Recipes: Natural Treatment For Rejuvenating And Hydrating All Skin Types - Melissa Georgia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Body butter is the ultimate necessity for women (and men) living in warm or dry weather. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This super concentrated lotion makes the body smooth, soft and amazingly beautiful. It makes the skin radiant and glowing in all conditions. However, buying body butter can sometimes lead you to investing more money than you are pleased with especially if you have dry skin or live in a dry weather environment. In that case, creating body butter at home can actually help you save some money. In addition, it can also give you the satisfaction of creating something that will actually become part of your daily beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These recipes are created using the everyday ingredients you can find easily at your local grocery stores. At times, you can create these homemade body butter recipes with some existing ingredients you already have at home. The procedure is so simple that no sort of disclaimer is essential other than being safe in the kitchen in general. All the instructions are laid down quite simply for anyone to understand and to follow.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In this collection, you will find over 40 Homemade Body Butter Recipes. A few major ingredients are jojoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil, beeswax, vanilla, shea butter, peppermint oil and various essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Try these recipes today and enjoy the luxury of using your own products to bring new life to your skin!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
