  <title>53 Stress Reduction Meal Recipes to Help You Get Through Tough Times and Moments of Anxiety: Delicious Meal Recipes to Help You Cope With Stress - Joe Correa CSN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stress is an emotional condition that is common for all human beings. There isn&#39;t a single person in this world who hasn&#39;tfeltstressed-out at some point in life. Stress is often correlated to binge eating which occurs as some form of response to  stressful situations.  We can&#39;t define stress as a disease, but more like an emotional state and the feeling of being unable to handle our problems. It slowly, without even noticing it, starts affecting our health in so many different ways. Our immune system starts to weaken, we feel tired, sick, and without energy. This leads our body into a state of a hormonal disbalance and sugar levels drop, which often results in overeating. Stress is a proven trigger to so many different and way more dangerous diseases." />
