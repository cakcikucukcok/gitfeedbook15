  <title>Power Harness: Living a New Existence - ImoonISun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to my world, Im going to take you into the mind of an individual who found her power through spirituality and womanhood.  No physical teacher, no physical mentor, no specific religion, no special woman teacher only the guides, angels,  relatives of the past, the shadows of my soul  in my dreams, waking life and intuition to receive guidance from.  
 For this special moment in time, I use my seemingly lonely journey to unveil a new way to exist in true power.  A truth no one will be able to validate for you as it a journey you must endure alone, despite the fact that your physical reality may share space with others.
Understand the importance of me sharing this book with you as I write this to you as a dear friend.  I hope to showcase my quirky, light humored side in this writing while breaking down my spiritual beliefs on how to get unstuck through finding your personal power.    Offering a refreshing break to seeking readers (who have also enjoyed serious-tone books) an opportunity to access their issue from a different lens.  I believe this piece will offer a different spiritual approach to often heavy life obstacles.  Its unique qualities hold a balance of simplicity and relatable writing; a form true to who I am with hopes of connecting to others.
 I finally realized I had everything I needed to change my life.    Hopefully, this book will inspire beauty during hard times." />
