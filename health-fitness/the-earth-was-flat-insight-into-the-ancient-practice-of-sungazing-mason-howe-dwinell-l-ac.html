  <title>The Earth Was Flat: Insight into the Ancient Practice of Sungazing - Mason Howe Dwinell L.Ac.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Impossible Is Nothing!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;New Book Brings to light self-discovery and Self-reform&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For centuries, people and researchers believed that it was impossible for human beings to live their lives without sustenance, and that their vision would be destroyed by looking straight at the sun.  Based on science, human eyes are not strong enough to resist the damage of direct sunlight while the human body has a natural cycle of hunger that has to be curbed.  But for author Mason Howe Dwinell, people can overcome such obstacles and even achieve the impossible.  These he elaborates deeply in his groundbreaking book titled &lt;i&gt;The Earth Was Flat: Insight into the Ancient Practice of Sungazing.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In its pages, &lt;i&gt;The Earth Was Flat&lt;/i&gt; explains that anything is possible and to evolve humans must dissolve subtle energy blocks that prevent them from experiencing their true potential.  In achieving the impossible, man must work through and surrender various emotions in order to achieve the transformation required for miraculous achievements. With such alterations people can actually stretch the preconceived limits of their minds, bodies, and spirits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Furthermore, Dwinell included in his book various stories of adventure and sheer intelligence, which can entertain and even educate any reader.  The content even compels people to look deep inside and re-evaluate themselves from within.  Not only is &lt;i&gt;The Earth Was Flat&lt;/i&gt; a scientific and entertaining reference, it is also an effective reference for self-discovery and even self-reform.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With amazing content, &lt;i&gt;The Earth Was Flat&lt;/i&gt; is highly recommended to a wide variety of readers that include psychologists, scientists, students, public officials, lawyers, professors, the working class, businessmen, and to anyone who is curious enough about mans existence in the world.  Dwinell, who has a masters degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine, crafted his book specifically to share his passion for the truth and to aid people who are willing to look inside themselves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
