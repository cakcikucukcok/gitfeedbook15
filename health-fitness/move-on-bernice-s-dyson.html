  <title>Move On - Bernice S. Dyson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bernice knows firsthand that life is an obstacle course full of challenging mental and physical obstacles.
  Like millions of other people she&#39;s  had to move on from some of life&#39;s most unbelievably challenging obstacles including everything from the death of her spouse to losing all of her businesses, losing her wealth, being deceived,  being disrespected, losing romantic relationships and losing her mind to name a few. 
  Growing up in Harlem, Bernice learned how to dream and to have the courage to pursue those dreams. This coupled up with loving herself, planning and being humble enough to seek help when she needed to, has enabled her to continuously MOVE ON with her life when faced with these obstacles. If the obstacle didn&#39;t kill her it  made her stronger, and luckily she&#39;s still here to talk about it.
  Bernice has had to MOVE ON over the past ten years more times than she can  remember, out of necessity to find herself actualization and happiness or find where she belongs and   with whom she would like to be. She&#39;s continuously MOVED ON by remaining positive, thinking planning and loving herself enough to know she deserves only the best that this life has to offer her.
  Bernice believes anyone can move on with their life and make it through any and all obstacles by taking one obstacle at a time, one day at a time, one foot in front of the other until you reach your finish line on your journey in life .It is vitally important to MOVE ON. FORGIVE YOUR PAST AND MOVE ON TO YOUR FUTURE WHERE YOUR HAPPINESS AWAITS YOU." />
