  <title>Crazy Love - Leslie Morgan Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At 22, Leslie Morgan Steiner seemed to have it all: a Harvard diploma, a glamorous job at &lt;i&gt;Seventeen&lt;/i&gt; magazine, a downtown New York City apartment. Plus a handsome, funny, street-smart boyfriend who adored her. But behind her façade of success, this golden girl hid a dark secret. She&#39;d made a mistake shared by millions: she fell in love with the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first Leslie and Conor seemed as perfect together as their fairy-tale wedding. Then came the fights she tried to ignore: he pushed her down the stairs of the house they bought together, poured coffee grinds over her hair as she dressed for a critical job interview, choked her during an argument, and threatened her with a gun. Several times, he came close to making good on his threat to kill her. With each attack, Leslie lost another piece of herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gripping and utterly compelling, &lt;i&gt;Crazy Love &lt;/i&gt;takes you inside the violent, devastating world of abusive love. Conor said he&#39;d been abused since he was a young boy, and love and rage danced intimately together in his psyche. Why didn&#39;t Leslie leave? She stayed because she loved him. Find out for yourself if she had fallen truly in love - or into a psychological trap. &lt;i&gt;Crazy Love&lt;/i&gt; will draw you in -- and never let go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
