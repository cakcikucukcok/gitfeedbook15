  <title>Tools for Creating a Life You Love - Colleen Ann Nilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Human life is a gift. The human mind is a powerful tool we each have to create what we want with the gift of our human experience.
What sets a master craftsman apart is their expert use of the tools of their craft. To use the tool of your mind as an expert, you need to understand how it works and practice using the tool to gain control. Through my study and practice I have put together tools and a process to help you to practice using the tool of your mind every minute to improve your mastery.
Expert practical use of ideas such as mindfulness, meditation, visualization, and learning to choose with awareness and self-control will change your experience of life.
Many people go through life reacting to lifes situations then wondering why they find themselves in the same painful situations over and over again. Feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, and angry many people feel victimized and out of control. This process helps you get control of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors so you are empowered to be the master craftsman of your life.
The first step is getting to know yourself. You need to gain awareness of both the conscious and subconscious aspects of your mind. You need to know how your thoughts, feelings, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors work together to create your experience. Once you have gained awareness, you get to choose what you want to create. Then, just as an athlete trains his body, you train your mind for control and mastery.
Change may not be easy but it is possible. You are the hero of your own adventure. If you become your best self, the world will be a better place. Your life is a terrible thing to waste." />
