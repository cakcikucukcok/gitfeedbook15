  <title>Inspiration for Living - Judy Tatelbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thank you my readers for your willingness to be inspired. We never know where our answers might lie. Our most important insights may come from a sentence in a book. I hope this is true for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating this book is the answer to a dream for me. I have wanted to be a writer since I was thirteen, but in those early days I had nothing to say. After I wrote THE COURAGE TO GRIEVE and then YOU DON&amp;rsquo;T HAVE TO SUFFER, I thought I was done writing books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still I never stopped wanting to inspire others with ideas about living well. It has always disturbed me that there is no training to be a human being, no lessons in coping with trauma, illness, loss and tragedy. Ours is a world filled with people learning in hit or miss ways how to confront the inevitable troubles and sorrows in life or how to have satisfying lives and successful relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is also no training for the biggest jobs most of us take on - like being a parent or a spouse. It&amp;rsquo;s startling that we have so little assistance or support for dealing with the things that matter most to us in life. Seeing that we really don&amp;rsquo;t have any &amp;ldquo;curriculum&amp;rdquo; other than our own trial and error ways for coping with our emotional lives led me to write all of my books and now these articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning my newsletter project, I thought or hoped to write maybe fifteen articles at most. Instead I have found an endless stream of inspiration, the sharing of which has been one of the greatest joys in my life. This book came as a surprise to me. My hope is that it is valuable for you. I am living Goethe&amp;rsquo;s words: &amp;ldquo;Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.&amp;rdquo; May those words encourage you too in whatever are your endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
