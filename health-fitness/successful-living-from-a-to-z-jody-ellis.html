  <title>Successful Living from A to Z - Jody Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Say to yourself, &#39;I am alive! I am really alive!&#39; Go through each day as if you were a new arrival in the world. Use all of your senses all day. See everything clearly. Listen to all sounds. Feel the vibration of life in your body and your mind. Be alert every minute. You&#39;ll experience a new day and a new life.&quot; With that statement, the author introduces a primer designed to assist the &quot;busy body&quot; in today&#39;s society. &quot;Successful Living&quot; can alter the direction of your life in more ways than you can imagine. Use it as a guide, take it at face value, share it with your children. From Alive to Zest, Knowledge to Quest, every letter of the alphabet is utilized to help the reader of any level fundamentally understand essential principles in the course of living a full life. Pick and choose which lessons are more relevant to your situation. Read the book in chronological order, skip through the chapters, or read it backwards. The teachings inside this little guide are universal. Good for life coaches, teachers of any discipline, business associates, philosophers, or anyone interested in seeking a new path of fulfillment, Jody Ellis&#39;s book can alter your life for the better. This is not a text that holds all the answers, but a remarkable testament of one individual&#39;s keen awareness that she would like to share with her readers. JODY ELLISs, born in Colorado in 1925, has enjoyed a successful and varied career in health care, business and the arts. She attended MacMurray College and served as a registered nurse in the U.S. Air Force in both the United States and Europe. Her business experiences include owning a candy company and a research firm specializing in work with authors and speakers. She was a founder of the Sunstone Press and its first President and a founder of the Santa Fe Community Orchestra. Fulfilling a lifelong interest in music, she became a cellist and music teacher. In recent years she has also become known as a composer of orchestral and piano music." />
