  <title>Think Like a Guy - Giuliana Depandi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How are you going to snag one if you don&#39;t know how to....&lt;i&gt;Think Like a Guy&lt;/i&gt;? E! News anchor Giuliana DePandi knows that if you want a little piece of his heart, you&#39;re going to have to learn to get into his head--and she shares her knowledge as an on-the-town dater in L.A. into this funny but oh-so-practical and effective volume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePandi knows what it&#39;s like &quot;out there&quot;, and has done extensive field work to learn what turns guys off...and on. Here&#39;s a pop quiz:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...mention your mom on a first date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...cook a guy breakfast after your first sleepover at his place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...pick at your food when he takes you to dinner?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...tell him how many lovers you&#39;ve had before he came along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...leave him long voicemails if you can&#39;t reach him on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resounding answer to all the questions above, according to DePandi, is: NO! You should, in fact, be busy and breezy, offer to pay for dinner, leave short voicemails (and none at all if you don&#39;t have anything concrete to say), stay well-dressed and -groomed, and make your guy feel like he&#39;s the first to introduce you to anything kinky in bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Think Like a Guy &lt;/i&gt; is a hard-headed practical book for women who acknowledge that men and women simply think differently.&lt;/p&gt;" />
