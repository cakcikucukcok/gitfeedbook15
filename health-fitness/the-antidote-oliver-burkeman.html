  <title>The Antidote - Oliver Burkeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Self-help books don&#39;t seem to work. Few of the many advantages of modern life seem capable of lifting our collective mood. Wealth--even if you can get it--doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to happiness. Romance, family life, and work often bring as much stress as joy. We can&#39;t even agree on what &quot;happiness&quot; means. So are we engaged in a futile pursuit? Or are we just going about it the wrong way? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking both east and west, in bulletins from the past and from far afield, Oliver Burkeman introduces us to an unusual group of people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. Whether experimental psychologists, terrorism experts, Buddhists, hardheaded business consultants, Greek philosophers, or modern-day gurus, they argue that in our personal lives, and in society at large, it&#39;s our constant effort to be happy that is making us miserable. And that there is an alternative path to happiness and success that involves embracing failure, pessimism, insecurity, and uncertainty--the very things we spend our lives trying to avoid. Thought-provoking, counterintuitive, and ultimately uplifting, &lt;i&gt;The Antidote &lt;/i&gt;is the intelligent person&#39;s guide to understanding the much-misunderstood idea of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
