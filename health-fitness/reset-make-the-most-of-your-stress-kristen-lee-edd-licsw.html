  <title>Reset: Make the Most of Your Stress - Kristen Lee EdD Licsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you make the most of your stress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESET: Make the Most of Your Stress&lt;/strong&gt; was named Motivational Book of 2015 Winner and a Finalist in the Self-Help and Health and Wellness categories by Next Generation Indie Book Awards. RESET has been called &lt;strong&gt;&quot;a breakthrough model that reframes our ideas about stress&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&quot;an excellent guide chock full of practical strategies, insightful stories, and wise advice for anyone who experiences stress in their daily work&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;There are far too many 5-step, simplistic models of stress reduction to go around. &lt;strong&gt;Reset&lt;/strong&gt; offers a fresh perspective that is not only backed up with years of research and clinical practice, but presented in a way that allows each reader to take into account their own circumstances and develop a plan for well-being that actually works.
When you feel the negative effects of stress and anxiety, &lt;strong&gt;RESET&#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; components will help you get your bearings and recalibrate: Realize. Energize. Soothe. End Unproductive Thinking. Talk it Out.
Whether you know it or not, you&#39;re already responding to stress-either constructively or destructively. Read &lt;strong&gt;RESET&lt;/strong&gt; to develop a plan that is unique to you and your circumstances to better equip you to respond to the challenges before you and make the most of your stress.&lt;br\&gt;" />
