  <title>Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life - Vanessa Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do you think God created your mind? In Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life, author Vanessa Clark explains that the brain is the most mysterious and misunderstood organ in the entire body. Its the source of our thoughts, our emotions, and memories. Our brain is responsible for whatever conscious efforts we make; the original supercomputer. When a developing fetus is only four weeks old its brain cells form at the rate of a quarter-million per minute. Without a brain to control the body, life wouldnt be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark believes that the brain was placed in our heads because its the top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a story in the Bible about a group of people who put their brains together and decided to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven. They began building and building. The Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the children of men were building. And the Lord said, Behold, the people are one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they imagined to do. (Gen. 11:6, King James 2000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They believed that something could be done and put that belief into action, so much so that the Lord had to come down to see. Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life explains that if we can imagine something and then meditate on it long enough, we can put it into action and achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
