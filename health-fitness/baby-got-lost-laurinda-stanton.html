  <title>Baby Got Lost - Laurinda Stanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are all types of families...what truly makes up a family is love...
In BABY GOT LOST, Nikki is upset when her dog doll goes missing.
This charming heartfelt story shows how a family pulls together to make their little girl feel better again. Losing a little doll may seem unimportant to some, but what is important is helping a child or any member of the family when they are feeling bad.
A family is love and support! 
BABY GOT LOST is a true story told to me by Nikkis parents, Lisa and Gerry.
They are a strong, no nonsense family whose love for their daughter had them feeling exactly what she was feeling....her sadness and also her joy when BABY was found !" />
