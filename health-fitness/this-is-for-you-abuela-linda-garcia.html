  <title>This Is for You, Abuela - Linda Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a heart felt story about a grandmother and granddaughters unconditional love for one another.  The love is so strong and undying.  Linda, our author, is a stronger person than she lets any one in on, and would like for people to look at her life as a success story.  Going through so many trials and tribulations, and set backs and still being able to raise her children on a very small income, and always being a working mom; she was able to overcome so many obstacles and still make sure her children had what they needed to get through everyday life.  Even though she longs for her fathers love, affection, and attention, and one on one relationship,  she was able to learn so much from everyone around her,.family members.  Linda grew up with her aunt Adelia as well as her maternal grandmother, and even though times were rough some days, she was able to grow to learn from and admire her aunt that took her in at a young age.  Even though her aunt Adelia had her own family and there were struggles within the household,  she was able to raise Linda, and teach her so much.  Linda will always love and appreciate , and respect her aunt Adelia for all she had to go through raising a rebellious adolescent, and not giving up.  Linda also loses faith in love and all that it stands for, not being able to open herself to marriage the way its supposed to be and a relationship with a man by her side, she floats endlessly like a lost soul and finds it hard to let her heart fall deeply in love, unconditionally.  (a major obstacle) for her.  Linda, would like to challenge her audience while reading her book, in the fact that, theres so much to learn and discover about life, when a parent dies, and children are left behind to make a name, and life for themselves, enduring everyday life as it comes at you.  Throughout reading you will find that everything about Lindas life, and the person she is today and has become, is like a shadow of who her nana was, and thanks to the man upstairs for never leaving her side, proves there is a God, and you should never give into losing your faith, and never give up, no matter how bad you want to or how bad things get.  In the end, striving to be your best acts as inspiration to others and you dont even know you could be helping others." />
