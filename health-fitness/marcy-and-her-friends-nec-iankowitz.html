  <title>Marcy and Her Friends - Nec Iankowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=justify&gt;
The first Marcy story was written to help my own second grader 
confront issues surrounding disorganization.  The second story 
was created to help her deal with a classroom bully.  That story 
was read by me to her class and received so well that it was 
followed, by popular demand, by twenty more.  The series 
developed as the wishes, fears and frustrations of my daughter&#39;s 
classmates, (and of several teachers), were reflected by Marcy 
who handled the problems they inspired. 
&lt;p align=justify&gt;
As my daughter grew, the Marcy stories served to remind her of 
many personal accomplishments. Then, once my younger 
daughter entered second grade, she was comforted by the stories 
until she began to face difficulties not yet handled by Marcy.  
Suddenly, Marcy had to discover a whole bunch of new 
adventures both in school and during summer sleep away camp. 
&lt;p align=justify&gt;
This book is geared towards first through third graders and has 
been piloted to students 7-10 years of age. It is a read aloud 
&quot;imagination series&quot; and intended to provide an interactive 
reading experience.  Students are encouraged to see Marcy 
through their own eyes, as Marcy has neither race nor religion of 
her own." />
