  <title>Fibromyalgia Well-Being - Dee Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2007, when Dee Campbell learned that she had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, she began a personal quest to learn all she could about the disease, treatments, and outlooks. Now she shares the result of her extensive personal research and experience, with the hope of inspiring others living with fibromyalgia to do just that: live. Her story is one of a journey back to health, happiness and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She draws on a range of interventions and embraces a holistic view of the individual. Dees success is a testimonial to the importance of remaining positive, empowered, and open-minded. Through her personal experiences and challenges, she hopes to encourage others living with fibromyalgia to seek their own enhanced quality of life. Life with fibromyalgia can be a challenge to mind, body, and soul, and, without support, these can be difficult, challenging, and confusing times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her own experiences, Dee recognizes the importance of addressing the physical, psychological, and spiritual elements of each individual in order to achieve improved well-being and long-term management of a chronic illness (and similar health problems or life challenges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are not alone in your journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyone with this illness can easily relate to this courageous and inspirational story  written by someone who has experienced the whole spectrum of fibromyalgia and all the frustrations and symptoms that go with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
