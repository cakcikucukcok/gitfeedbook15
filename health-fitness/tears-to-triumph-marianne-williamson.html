  <title>Tears to Triumph - Marianne Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The internationally recognized teacher, speaker, and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;A Return to Love&lt;/em&gt; argues that our desire to avoid pain is actually detrimental to our lives, disconnecting us from our deepest emotions and preventing true healing and spiritual transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianne Williamson is a bestselling author, world-renowned teacher, and one of the most important spiritual voices of our time. In &lt;em&gt;Tears to Triumph&lt;/em&gt;, she argues that we&amp;#8212;as a culture and as individuals&amp;#8212;have learned to avoid facing pain. By doing so, we are neglecting the spiritual work of healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of allowing ourselves to embrace our hurt, we numb it, medicate it, dismiss it, or otherwise divert our attention so that we never have to face it. In refusing to acknowledge our suffering, we actually prolong it and deny ourselves the opportunity for profound wisdom&amp;#8212;ultimately limiting our personal growth and opportunity for enlightenment. Frozen by denial, we are left standing in the breech. Whole industries profit from this immobility, and while they have grown rich, we have become spiritually poorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Marianne makes clear, true healing and transcendence can only come when we finally face our pain and wrestle with what it has to teach us. Written with warm compassion and profound wisdom, &lt;em&gt;Tears to Triumph&lt;/em&gt; offers us a powerful way forward through the pain, to a deeper awareness of our feelings, our lives, and our true selves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
