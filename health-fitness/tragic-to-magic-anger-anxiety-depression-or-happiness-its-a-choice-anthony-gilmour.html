  <title>Tragic to Magic: Anger, Anxiety, Depression or Happiness, its a choice - Anthony Gilmour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone will get something from this book. It might be how to break the communication habits that stop one from having a happy relationship or how to improve self-esteem. It could be how to be a better manager of people or how to get over anxiety, trauma, anger, abuse or depression. It&#39;s not rocket science. It&#39;s about learning to live a happy life.  Anthony Gilmour is a psychotherapist who specializes in anxiety and depression. His book, Tragic to Magic, never wavers from the point that our ultimate goal is happiness. The lessons in this book are simple, easy to understand and use. They are born of his studies and successful practice in psychotherapy over the past ten years.  Tony Gilmour takes complex theories and turns them into something so simple that most people will say it is just common sense. (But common sense is not that common!) Know your mind and you will understand your problems. From this point, you can overcome them. This book contains simple understandings, tools and techniques to live a happier life. True success in life is being happy, our ultimate goal." />
