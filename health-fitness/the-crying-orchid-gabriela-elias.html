  <title>The Crying Orchid - Gabriela Elias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michaela Martenz is a dreamer. As a young woman living in Eastern Europe in the 1980s, she wants adventure and passion in her life, and nothing will stop her from achieving that. She is courted by Eduard Verner, a charming man who promises her that and more, but in her naivet, she fails to recognize the warning signs of an abusive relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the warnings of her friends and family, Michaela marries Eduard and moves away, leaving everyone she knows behindincluding her best friend, Nikolas, who has always loved her. But instead of happiness, her new life is a nightmare of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her controlling, jealous, alcoholic husband. Now a young mother to little Orchid, she fears for her daughters safety as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product of a broken home herself, Michaela is determined to keep her family together for Orchids sake. She knows that Eduards own abusive childhood has affected his life in unspeakable ways and prevents him from seeing the impact of his behaviour on his own family. Michaela does everything she can think of to fix her shattered marriage, but nothing is helping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Eduard seriously injures their three-year-old daughter, Michaela reaches a breaking point. Aware of the risks, she must now find the courage needed to leave her abusive marriage behind and start a new life. But an enraged Eduard is not about to relinquish control over his family. Will his threats undermine her newfound resolve and freedom?&lt;/p&gt;" />
