What if you have just suffered a severe loss or many losses? Where do you turn when everything you&#39;ve worked so hard to build up suddenly and completely falls apart?&lt;P&gt;	A Place Called Happiness, while understanding that circumstances and events of our lives can be anywhere from mildly difficult to brutalizing, nevertheless affirms a permanent pathway to a state of overriding contentment. &lt;P&gt;	In this concise, readable book, Dr. Dori Seider allows us to encounter, gently yet powerfully, the internal barriers that keep us from our own happiness. She helps us to define a new approach that will invite our contentment in, ask it to stay longer, and make it feel so at home that it will return to us more often.&lt;P&gt;	The book is divided into four parts: Losing Your Happiness, Changing Your Mind, Finding Your Truth, and Loving Your Life. Dr. Seider insists that even in a very troubled world it is possible for each of us to create an enduring sense of well-being, and she shows us how.&lt;/P&gt;" />
