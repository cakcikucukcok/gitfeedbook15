  <title>Tangled Webs - Barbara M. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bringing up a child is a time-consuming but rewarding task for any parent. But what is it like for the parent of a child with disabilities? What then?  Anxious and concerned parents, conscientious or dismissive caregivers, arrogant or caring do-gooders, insensitive or dedicated professionals, all come together to form Tangled Webs through which the journey of a child with disabilities and her family is portrayed. This is the story of the dedication of the people who supported Sharon, who was born with Down Syndrome. She matures despite all headaches, problems, and doomsayers, to become independent from her family. It is a story of triumph in a world of adversity.  Tangled Webs has a message for everyone in today&#39;s society; parents, educators, social workers and medical care providers; anyone who has contact with people with disabilities." />
