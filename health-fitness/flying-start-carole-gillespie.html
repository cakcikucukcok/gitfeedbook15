      <meta name="description" content="To be Noticed, Supported and Promoted: that’s the goal of most people as they start their career or business, and build the foundation for their long-term success. It is even better if this can be achieved in a way that is effective and feels right. Carole Gillespie explains the six natural behaviours - The Relationship CodeTM - that will enable you to do this. You’ll learn how to build your support network, stand out from the crowd and give people the confidence to take a chance on you. Gillespie brings this to life in a practical and easy to apply way. A series of Q&amp;As show how to use the Relationship Code to tackle real life career and brand defining situations from the start of your journey through to your late twenties. By following her empowering process you can create your own luck whatever your background. Use the Relationship Code to make a Flying Start and tilt the playing field in your favour. That’s how to get ahead of the pack and be really lucky at work. This is the first in a series of career enhancement books. Flying Start is designed for those about to join the world of work or in their foundation working years, and for those who employ, advise or guide them.
