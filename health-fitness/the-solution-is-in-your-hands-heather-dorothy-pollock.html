  <title>The Solution Is in Your Hands - Heather Dorothy Pollock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;As a parent or teacher of children with learning or behavioral difficulties, youre likely to feel worried or anxious. You might also be frustrated and stressed, having tried a range of things to help resolve the problems without success. In The Solution is in Your Hands, author Heather Dorothy Pollock offers a guide to help parents and teachers recognize children are unique individuals who need a safe, holistic approach, rather than expecting one label or one strategy to fix all.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It encourages the understanding that more of the samemore teaching, writing, homework, or tutoringisnt the answer and wont effectively change anything. The Solution is in Your Hands provides a greater understanding of whats happening for the children, enabling early intervention, the implementation of strategies, and the celebration of success. It teaches how change will manifest without the need for drugs, counseling, punishment, condemnation, or medical intervention and eliminate the need for travel, appointments, and pressure on the family budget.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Based on her seventeen years of experiences, Pollock shows that with an investment of as little as one hour per month for therapy and fifteen minutes a day for exercises, parents and teachers can effectively achieve sustainable results.&lt;/P&gt;" />
