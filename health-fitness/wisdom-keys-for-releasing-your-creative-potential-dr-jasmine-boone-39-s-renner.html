  <title>Wisdom Keys for Releasing Your Creative Potential - Dr. Jasmine Boone&#39;s Renner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wisdom Keys for Unlocking Your Creative Potential was birthed out of my journey and quest for wisdom. In the process, I gained knowledge and understanding and was unleashed into my creative potential. This book provides valuable keys for unlocking your unlimited creative potential. My aim in this book is to help individuals realize and understand the depth of their creative abilities and to use the multifaceted wisdom keys espoused in this book to unlock their creative potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creativity has no doubt become an evasive concept for many. Many people value it, many want it but few ever get to expressing it. Why is it so? The goal of this book is to introduce you to the invaluable nuggets gained from discovering that creativity is not an additional project you add to your already full to do list but springs out of the essence of who you really are. Wisdom is the ability to discern, accept and to work in your creative abilities. In other words, wisdom is simply knowing what to do, when to do it, where to do it and with whom to do it with. This book also reflects the countless hours spent seeking wisdom steps or keys on the subject matter of creativity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using wisdom as a guide and tool in understand and releasing your creative potential is crucial. I point out in this book, that wisdom is an essential part of the quantum or spiritual level of creativity. Therefore in this wisdom keys and creativity series, I will attempt to begin a dialogue on the role of wisdom in creativity to lay the foundation for continued discourse on the topic. The keys espoused in this book are the same and can be applied in every nation, in every tribe and for all peoples. This is because there are universal undeniable principles that govern every human being. The wisdom keys espoused in this book are universal for all who will dare to use then appropriately. A farmer in Australia applying these keys correctly will have the same result as a billionaire in Wall Street. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My desire is that as you read this book you will be birthed into an awareness about your creative potential and that your heart will be opened up for a download, an outpouring of this understanding. You may also need to create what I call a consistent &amp;quot;creative environment&amp;quot; and avoid creative cramps by doing some strategic things in your quest to release your creative potential." />
