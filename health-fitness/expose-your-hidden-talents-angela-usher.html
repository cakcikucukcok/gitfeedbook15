  <title>Expose Your Hidden Talents - Angela Usher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am an advocate of &#39;self-improvement, the straightening out process and the bigger picture where spirituality is concerned. Even though it may appear; Im a controversial writer, the reality is: I only state clear and precise true facts. In these modern times, I believe that too many people become seriously caught up in this &#39;global fast paced world&#39; of technology. Most people are trapped in error. Many people dont creatively thrive. Many people are not consciously aware that they are programmed and conditioned to think in a humanistic robotic fast pace way. People become trapped in their ruts. 
The world is seriously confused. This is a world that is dangerously losing its way. Christian values seriously need to be brought back into the world. In this book, I encourage hobbies and therapy techniques, for the purpose of logic and constructive thoughts. I also analyze conscious thought, open-mindedness and new awarenesss through natural logic and reasoning. In order for a person to break away from distracted error; (a person should use their own intelligence, logic and common sense, find out the absolute truth involving the facts; also use Gods Wisdom; pray, be open minded, find true spiritual direction, also become self educated, learn new awareness &amp; find graceful hope with God.) As a writer, I continue working towards the cause of: a better world. I created some amazing profound parts of this book, through divine providence granted to me from the grace of God." />
