  <title>The Art of Selling the Art of Healing - Alex Lubarsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The most important ingredient in the art of healing is the art of selling. I say that with all the respect in the world for every other part of this vast system of care that has grown into a sprawling and complex three-trillion-dollar metropolis. 
For the last sixty or so years, the providers of care have depended on third-party entities to handle the part of selling for them. From insurance companies who sold millions of people on the importance of paying monthly premiums for health-care insurance to the government that did the same thing under the more intimidating, compulsory taxation. Today, we have come to a fork in the road where (as the system implodes) those who control the flow of monetary resources are filling their own bank accounts, leaving the people who are busy providing care on that field of battle with all supply lines cut off. 
Many healers are, therefore, forced to shed all the entities that have forced themselves between the doctor and her patient. Exploring their original entrepreneurial roots, allowing the patient to bypass all middlemen and pay the doctor for care directly. 
The trouble comes in when the healing professional steps out of a world where all the marketing was handled for them and the only thing they needed to know was how to submit a bill to a third-party payer for reimbursement. So when embarking on this new journey of building a concierge, pay-for-service practice, many are derailed by the Flat Earth Fallacy that is a perception of things as they seem but are, in reality, very different. 
This book then is to share some field-tested experiences that will, in all probability, save the health-care entrepreneur some pain and expense, while providing a perspective on the driving elements of success in the art of selling the art of healing." />
