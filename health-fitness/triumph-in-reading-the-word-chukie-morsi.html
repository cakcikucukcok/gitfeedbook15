  <title>Triumph in Reading the Word - Chukie Morsi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Proverbs 13:15 &quot;Good understanding gains (gives) favour, but the way of the transgressors is hard (difficult).&quot; (Emphasis Mine)
A man&#39;s ignorance is his own mountain; but the knowledge and understanding of the truth which is based on the living Word of God; birthed and breathed by the Holy Spirit will always deliver, direct and prosper to give your life meaningful success with fulfilment.
REVD CHUKIE MORSI, a Bible Teacher, pastor, publisher, spiritual advisor, consultant and now author, has delved into this mesage in a didactic manner. The intention of this book, TRIUMPH IN READING THE WORD is to emancipate individuals and the church from the famine of hearing the Word of God in the midst of challenges...
Amos 8:11-13 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall wander form sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the Word of the Lord, and shall not find it. In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
This book is written to awaken you to the need for knowledge, understanding and wisdom in doing life and dealing with the falsehood of dogmatism and Methodism through religious traditions and doctrinal misfits that have held people in the clusters of ignorance and bondage. In order to rule in the midst of your enemies (Psalms 110:2) and reign in life triumphantly and in dominion (Romans 5:17; 2 Corinthians 2:14), this book is the believers synergy towards it.
Acts 20:32 &quot;So now brethren, I commend you to God &amp; to the Word of His grace which is able to build you up &amp; give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.&quot;" />
