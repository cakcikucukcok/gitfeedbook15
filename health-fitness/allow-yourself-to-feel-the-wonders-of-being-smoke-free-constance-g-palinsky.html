This method can help set you freefree from smoking, free from unearned guilt and pain. The text is divided in two sections, which mirror the two sessions used for clients face-to-face.
You can imagine you are in my office and read the book straight through. Each session focuses on bringing your awareness to your conscious behavior, implanting vivid images, teaching you how to breathe well during the process of quitting, and helping you understand the social forces that have driven you to smoke.
