  <title>The Monk and the Tree - James Scheller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mother Ayahuasca, How long have I known my wife? To this simple yet inspired question, asked by author James H. Scheller; the answer unveiled to him is the story of &lt;i&gt;The Monk&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and the Tree&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child monk named Malian, is special for so many reasonsnotably, she is a girl who has been accepted into the Dao monkhood, an honor typically denied to women, during this age of time of unwritten history. So pure and in tune is Malians spirit with the Dao that she is truly &lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;with all around her. She is on a path, reveling in the simple act of living, when she meets a small, furry creature. The little animal leads Malian to a quiet and peaceful place high above a beautiful valley, and implores her to play music for the forest. She plays, unwittingly rousing the discomforted spirit of the tree at whose roots shes settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling his energy surround her, Malian is moved by the disquiet within the treeand the tree hopes beyond hope that Malian can quiet the discord within him. Where does love come from, and what can it endure? Find out in this hauntingly resonant tale of lives past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
