  <title>Bringing Lucy Home: A Story of Hope, Heartache, and Happiness - Jennifer Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An orphan, abandoned and alone. A family, comfortable and secure. A shaky step of faith. An unprecedented complication. A heartbreaking separation. An unyielding quest. A love story that is every Christian&#39;s story. Bringing Lucy Home shares the compelling drama of one family&#39;s relentless pursuit to bring hope into the life of an orphaned baby girl. In itself, this account would merely duplicate the narratives of other adoptive families. However, Jennifer Phillips&#39; journey unexpectedly detoured into heartache, causing indefinite separation from her husband and three biological children. Jennifer&#39;s struggle was not merely with an inflexible system, but with trusting God more deeply. In the end, her family was reunited not merely by political and legal pressures, but by God&#39;s hand. He was at work, using every disappointment to teach a young mother about His unrelenting love. Join the thousands who have walked alongside Jennifer and Lucy as they tried to reunite with their family. Jennifer&#39;s humor and vulnerability will captivate your heart and transform her story into your story as your eyes are opened to deep gospel truths that are only unearthed in the soil of suffering.   You were lost. You were pursued. You are worth whatever it costs to bring you home, for good." />
