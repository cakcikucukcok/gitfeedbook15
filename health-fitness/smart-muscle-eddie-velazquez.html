  <title>Smart Muscle - Eddie Velazquez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of books on how to exercise. How many tell you how not to exercise and why? Not everyone can perform the exercises that professional athletes do without risking injury. Thats why the average busy person will last only about one to two weeks on an exercise program before giving up. The programs are either too intense or too long in duration. The average businessperson or home maker has very little flexibility in time and less opportunity to learn how exercises are to be done or not done. This book provides exercise programs that will provide results quickly without pushing the envelope of safety. Eddie Velazquez, certified medical representative and 4th degree Black Belt in Karate, shows you how, with a busy career and family life, you can still attain a fit and healthy body without sacrificing your personal and business life. Enjoy your life with a vibrant body that will make you not be afraid to join the fun just because youre past 35, 40, or beyond. Youre never too old to start exercising as long as you know how to exercise correctly. Be smart, train smart. Smart Muscle will get you started.&lt;/p&gt;" />
