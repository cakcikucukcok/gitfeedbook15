  <title>Black Women Are Crazy as Hell - King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has more wisdom in it than Oprah, Dr. Phil and a bookstore combined.  It will answer life-changing questions, such as: what do men look for in women?
Is it true that you have given up on men because all the good ones are taken, or because all men cheat, are broke, or are in jail?  If one of these thoughts has flickered through your thoughts, then this book is for you. Whining to a girlfriend or asking for advice is like the blind leading the blind. I would like you to ask yourself serious questions, like: will I be with someone special this coming holiday?  For Valentines Day? On the next rainy night, or for my next birthday or special occasion?  If the answer is no, ask yourself why? 
Whether you are single or married, this is a guide to help you identify common mistakes and poor choices that cause bad relationships, and to show you what you can do to make your future relationships fantastic. We will explore some very hurtful and painful things that real people have done, things that have affected peoples lives and can never be undone. Inside you will find everything you need to know, so these mistakes and poor choices will never, ever happen again.
I guarantee if you follow these steps, great things will happen and you will live a long and happy life with someone who loves you just as much as you love them." />
