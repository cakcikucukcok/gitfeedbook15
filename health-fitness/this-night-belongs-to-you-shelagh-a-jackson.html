  <title>This Night Belongs to You - Shelagh A. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do friends deal with betrayal, incest, rape, sexual promiscuity, and broken hearts? A town filled with wayward teenagers attempting to live an adult life, quickly learn that through all the hurt and pain, and through all the joy and laughter, all that glitters isn&#39;t gold. 
A dangerous mystery lies with the new family in town, and Stacey Petersen, the heartbroken and immature idol, has fallen head over heels for the seductive son. Roger Jones carries a cloud of mystery and unforeseen danger wherever he goes. But, despite the danger, Stacey is determined to get her man. She&#39;s even willing to risk friendship and her family&#39;s trust to be a part of his world. Even though Roger&#39;s lustful eyes can&#39;t seem to escape Stacey&#39;s overt advances, he&#39;s determined to hold on to his family&#39;s secrets, including the question of his whereabouts when he disappears on business trips for days at a time. Do you think he&#39;s seeing someone else?&quot; her beloved friend Donna asked. On her quest to get her man, Stacey will find that she will get more than she bargained for. Trapped in the tumultuous whirlwind that lies between childhood and adulthood, Stacey and her company of adolescent friends will find themselves facing many of life&#39;s ugly truths and a wealth of unanswered questions, which teenagers haven&#39;t yet acquired the life experiences to deal with. 
This Night Belongs to You combines humor with realism in telling the murderous tale of a young girl&#39;s coming of age. It is a novel about the joy of friendship, about the influence of family on adolescence, about the psychology of sexual misbehavior, and last but never least.....it is a story about the calming beauty of love." />
