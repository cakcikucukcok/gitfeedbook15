  <title>Tomas - L.J. Diva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of the bonkbustingly good Jackie Collins, comes L.J. Diva&amp;rsquo;s Porn Star Brothers series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the meteoric rise of 70s Porn Star, Tomas Stefan, and the rocky path he took to find the life and love he craved in the Porn Star Brothers series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tomas Stephanopoulos is the second of three Australian born and Greek Island raised brothers. He loves his job as a personal trainer and has no interest in emulating his elder brother by bedding all of the eligible women on the island.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He lives the good life, training the ladies at the island&amp;rsquo;s resort, and taking on personal clients at night. Then he meets one client who wants more than personal training. A client who wants &lt;i&gt;intimate&lt;/i&gt; training.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With his brothers on the run, he chooses to spread his wings and moves to Miami to personally train the ladies who were his clients back on Mykonos. After meeting the love of his life he moves into porn movies with a new name and a new life, but the drama has followed him from home and continues with his lover&amp;rsquo;s car being trashed, porn stars being killed off, and a double kidnapping that leads to a dramatic car chase across the country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And it all comes down to one person&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One person who&amp;rsquo;s out to end the life of Tomas Stephanopoulos&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tomas&lt;/i&gt; is the third novella in the Porn Star Brothers contemporary romance series featuring the sizzlingly sexy middle Greek Australian bad boy brother. If you like family sagas, heartfelt romances and dancing to &amp;rsquo;70s disco, then you&amp;rsquo;ll love the latest instalment in L.J. Diva&amp;rsquo;s page-turning series.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***If you think the story ends abruptly, or without a conclusion, that&amp;rsquo;s because part 4 of the Porn Star Brothers series, Retribution, is the conclusion to all three Porn Star Brothers books." />
