  <title>From Here to Maternity - Kris Webb, Kathy Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning coffee sessions are never going to be the same. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney marketing exec Sophie presumed &quot;making sacrifices for your children&quot; meant giving up Bloody Marys and champagne for nine months. When she thought about it, that is. . . . But then two blue lines appear on her pregnancy test. How does a baby fit in with a hectic job, a chaotic social life, and the absence of Max, the Y chromosome in the equation, who has moved to San Francisco?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support and dubious advice are provided by an unlikely group that gathers for a weekly coffee get-together at the King Street Cafe. With Debbie the glamorous man-eater, Andrew the fitness junkie, Anna the disaster-prone doctor, and Karen the statistically improbable happily married mother of three, Sophie discovers the ups and downs of motherhood. And when an unexpected business venture and a new man appear on the scene, it appears that just maybe there is life after a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by two sisters who live on different continents, Kris Webb and Kathy Wilson, &lt;i&gt;From Here to Maternity&lt;/i&gt; is a novel that tackles the balancing of motherhood, romance, and a career, while managing to be seriously funny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
