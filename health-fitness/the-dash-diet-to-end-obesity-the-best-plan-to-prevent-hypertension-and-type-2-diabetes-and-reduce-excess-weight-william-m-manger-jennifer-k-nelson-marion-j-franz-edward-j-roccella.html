  <title>The Dash Diet to End Obesity: The Best Plan to Prevent Hypertension and Type-2 Diabetes and Reduce Excess Weight - William M. Manger, Jennifer K. Nelson, Marion J. Franz, Edward J Roccella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Called the &amp;#147;good nutrition bible&amp;#8221; by one reviewer, &lt;I&gt;The DASH Diet to End Obesity&lt;/I&gt; is the ultimate guide to common sense-lifestyle changes that will improve the health of the entire family. With a special emphasis on prevention, this book is written for parents, teachers, and anyone concerned about protecting themselves and their children from the health risks of obesity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book is the most comprehensive guide to the DASH diet plan yet published. DASH&amp;#174; - Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension - was first formulated to combat hypertension (high blood pressure). But numerous studies have shown that the eating plan is also useful for dealing with excess weight, abnormal blood fats, Type 2 diabetes, and other health concerns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The DASH diet has soared in popularity because not only does it allow people to take charge of their own health and that of their families, they can do it while eating delicious food. The plan emphasizes seasonings, spices, healthy oils, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other flavorful food choices.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But unlike a mere recipe book, &lt;I&gt;The DASH Diet to End Obesity&lt;/I&gt; explains the science and psychology of how to find success with the DASH approach. Author Dr. William Manger and his three distinguished colleagues have crafted a reader-friendly book geared to motivate people to make healthy, informed changes in their daily lives. The book offers in-depth information about fats, cholesterols, vitamins and minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and more. An entire section is devoted to the role of salt and the dangers of consuming too much salt, especially for people who are overweight. The book also contains a special chapter about eating for the management of diabetes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not only do the authors present a lot of information in an accessible tone, they provide detailed descriptions of how to incorporate this knowledge into every meal with memory strategies, charts, and quick tips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The DASH eating plan is not just a diet, however, and the book covers the importance of sleep, physical exercise, and staying psychologically motivated. The authors also dissect the reasons other diets fail, and discuss the risks and benefits of other methods of weight loss, including surgery and weight-loss drugs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book represents the life work of the four prestigious authors; it is not a jump-on-the-bandwagon response to the recent popularity of the DASH diet. Dr. William Manger has been such a proponent of the DASH lifestyle that he has founded an organization that teaches the eating plan to young children in schools.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Medical researchers and experts today are saying many parents could outlive their children because of runaway childhood obesity. This is the scenario &lt;I&gt;The DASH Diet to End Obesity&lt;/I&gt; is dedicated to reversing.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
