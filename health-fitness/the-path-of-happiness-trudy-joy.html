  <title>The Path of Happiness - Trudy Joy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever had a feeling within you that felt bigger than you, a knowing and overwhelming feeling that you must act upon something unknown? 
When Trudy separated from her husband, she needed something that would give her and her young daughter some hope, some optimism and reassurance that their future life as a single parent family was going to be okay. Trudy needed to understand that she was not the only one who was feeling unsure and insecurethat she wasnt alone, sailing in an ocean of heartbreak and uncertainty. She wanted to read that someone had come through the worst of times and been able to create a positive, new, happily-balanced life for themselves and their children. When she found websites geared towards single parents, their words of wisdom were very matter-of-fact. Within the words, there was nothing that seemed personal that she could connect to directly. She didnt read anything that gave her the warm inner glow of comfort. And The Path of Happiness was born. Learning as she went, Trudy found that writing about the incidents she encountered and had dealt with helped her with the rejuvenation process itself. Challenges were surmounted, goals reached, and with each one, Trudy learned a little more about herself. Written from experience, The Path of Happiness is Trudys first-hand survival guide for single parents, with tips on everything from budgeting and lifestyle, to dealing with the emotional rollercoaster and other obstacles encountered on her and her daughters journey." />
