  <title>Fearfully and Wonderfully Made - Sarah Elizabeth Alvarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fearfully and Wonderfully Made is a biographical account of a young girl who grew up with her parents and siblings in a modest home in Upstate New York in the late 60s and early 70s. Sarah was emotionally and physically abused by her mother and sexually abused by her father.
Throughout her childhood, she sought comfort and refuge in her intimate relationship with God. In her midtwenties, she becomes a mother of a darling little boy and was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Her life seems complete when Sarah meets her future husband, Nehemiah, while vacationing in the Caribbean. They happily raise their vivacious baby boy. Then Nehemiah is incarcerated for selling prescription drugs to an undercover detective. She is left alone to raise her children. Her faith is tested, but she proves to be unshakable.
Sarah eventually reconciles with her mother and fully embraces her past.
This true story was written with the deep desire of shedding light on the serious effects of child abuse and to inspire others to never give up hope." />
