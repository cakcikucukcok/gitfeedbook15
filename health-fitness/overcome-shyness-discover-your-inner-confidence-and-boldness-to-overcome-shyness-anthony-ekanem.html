  <title>Overcome Shyness: Discover Your Inner Confidence and Boldness to Overcome Shyness - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we think of someone being shy, we may think of a child who is hiding behind the leg of her mother because she fears strangers.  Shyness was once considered to be an asset for little girls as well as women because it was associated with modesty. I can remember my daughter hiding behind my leg when she was a little girl and thinking that it was so cute. I never saw shyness as an impediment and, like many other adults, found this type of behavior very &quot;cute.&quot;    Shyness is not cute.  To the contrary, it can cause you all sorts of problems in life. People who are shy are usually unable to express their feelings and have a much more difficult time when it comes to building relationships. My daughter, for example, found it difficult to make friends as she got older and to talk to strangers at parties. While people found her to be cute as a child as she hid behind my leg, they found her to be aloof and unfriendly as she blossomed into adulthood." />
