      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Allergy-Proof Your Life&lt;/I&gt; offers the billions of allery-sufferers around the world an opportunity to discover their body&amp;#8217;s potential underlying weaknesses such as nutritional deficiencies, bodily imbalances, and lifestyle choices so you can get to the bottom of what&amp;#8217;s causing the allergies and get rid of them! Addressing the root causes of allergies is much more effective than taking a drug-based Band-Aid approach that merely lessens symptoms and worsens health in the long term.&lt;BR&gt;When it comes to allergies, what your doctor doesn&amp;#8217;t know is hurting you. Allergy-Proof Your Life works by resetting your natural body chemistry and addressing the underlying causal factors for allergies instead of the medical approach to reduce symptoms at a high cost to the body. As readers  will soon discover, cutting edge research shows that low-grade inflammation, nutritional deficiencies, a leaky or inflamed gut, and an inflammatory diet puts everyone at risk of experiencing allergies or aggravating existing allergies.&lt;BR&gt;In Allergy-Proof Your Life award-winning natural health expert Dr. Cook will reveal how you can eat to beat inflammation, identify foods that contribute to environmental and seasonal allergies and foods that heal them, reverse nutritional deficiencies, and heal the gut imbalances that are frequently at the root of allergies. Sadly, that&amp;#8217;s probably not something your doctor has ever told you.&lt;br&gt;Readers will  find dozens of cutting-edge, scientifically-proven natural therapies and remedies for allergies that have never before been compiled into a single book and many of which are virtually unknown&amp;#151;the product of her twenty-five years of research and experience in the natural health field.&lt;/div&gt;" />
