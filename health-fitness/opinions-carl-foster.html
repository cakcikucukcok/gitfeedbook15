  <title>Opinions - Carl Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Description
     At the opening of OPINIONS is a brief summary of some of the recommended rules to follow when composing a letter to the editor.  This is followed by another summary of a number of ways to get your opinions read not only in your local newspapers but on the internet through social networking and in a personal blog.
       Included in OPINIONS is a series of Letters to the Editor plus a few editorials that have been written by the author.   All have been published in one or more newspapers.  In addition, several personal letters to individuals or to organizations have been added in which similar tactics were used.  Along with each of the letters are comments by the author which are in italics. 
     These comments are intended to make a point and more important, to demonstrate the tactic used to express his opposition to or his support for an action  or a lack of action.  The trick is to make the point, destroy the opposition and do it without making a direct, personal attack on an individual or organization.  
      Using a rather unique style, the author injects just enough humor in his letters to take some (but not all) of the sting out of his comments.   Sometimes readers take him literally, and this does raise the interest level." />
