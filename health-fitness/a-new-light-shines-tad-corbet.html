  <title>A New Light Shines - Tad Corbet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For years, Tad Corbet has written verses, sayings, and odes about life based on his work, first as a minister, then as a clinical psychologist with the people [he] met along lifes way, whose painful emotional experiences and/or whose fun times elicited most of the responses in this book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The only reason most moments in life are not among the best is because of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I was young and had some dreams. Too ideal, many said. And I had a tendency and a temptation to let them go but never did. If I had, I may have died and never lived the life that is truly me. So if you seem to have lost your way, look backward and rediscover the ideals of your youth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two verses reflect central themes of &lt;i&gt;A New Light Shines&lt;/i&gt;: self-acceptance and self-reliance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you like the book, tell your friends. If you dont, refer it to your enemies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
