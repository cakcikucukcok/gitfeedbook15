  <title>Loony Intelligence - PhD Badenhorst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The economic downturn has taken most people by surprise. Only a few economists and some so-called &quot;whistle blowers&quot; warned of the imminent crisis. As a psychologist, Dr. Lieselotte Badenhorst believes politicians and economists are still talking around the real issue of the crisis. Her views of the current situation are based on the reality that we as human beings have become too rational in the way we live and think. World leaders, CEOs, managers, housewives and students need to develop what she calls Loony Intelligence, or LQ. This intelligence includes spiritual, emotional and creative intelligence. LQ is the ability to deal with crisis situations or chaos. Chaos theory suggests there is no such thing as complete and accurate information. Therefore, we need to take a radically new viewpoint on how we make decisions and to question the value of always adhering to logic. Badenhorst believes, as Carl G. Jung did, that we are connected to the collective unconscious, but we have lost this connection because of our left brain education. In other words, &quot;We have to become spontaneous and authentic again, rediscover our true nature and develop our Loony Intelligence" />
