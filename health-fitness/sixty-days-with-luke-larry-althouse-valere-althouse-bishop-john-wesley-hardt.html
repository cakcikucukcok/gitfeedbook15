  <title>Sixty Days with Luke: - Larry Althouse, Valere Althouse, Bishop John Wesley Hardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to help the reader to spend sixty rewarding days in the Third Gospel, following a schedule of readings taking the reader through Lukes 24 chapters. All too often the Gospels are experienced in bits and pieces. This book will expose the reader to the whole Gospel of Luke, providing a fuller sense of the scope and continuity of this marvelous tract of faith. The daily interpretations are intended, not as exhaustive expositions of all that is intended by the various passages, but as meditations, suggestive of contemplation, musing, pondering, reflection, study or thought,. With each days reading and meditation, there is a daily suggestion of a thought to ponder and prime the pump of the readers own mind and heart. Stimulated by these thoughts and questions, readers may find the Holy Spirit leading them to what is important and relevant for their own lives. Each day ends with a prayer-starter intended to suggest the direction in which the readers own prayers might be directed. No Amen is added because they are intended to be open-ended for the reader to complete. The study and prayer sections are equally important." />
