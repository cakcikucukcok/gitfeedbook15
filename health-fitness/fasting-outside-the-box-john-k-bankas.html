  <title>Fasting Outside the Box - John K. Bankas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If there is ever a chance to understand fasting once and for all and incorporated it into your spiritual life, Fasting Outside the Box will exceed your expectations and revolutionize your walk with God.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The differentiation of fasting inside or outside the box is very thought-provoking as it reveals the contrast between ones motives and the condition of the heart. Fasting was commonplace with the early leaders of the Church and it is still one of the most impactful disciplines that draws us into a closer intimacy with God. Pastor Bankas maintains that fasting not only ignites the fire of our devotion and commitment to God but also intensifies and strengthens our prayer life. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With great insight, he shows you how to&lt;br /&gt;
Hang out with God&lt;br /&gt;
Purify your heart&lt;br /&gt;
Come near to God&lt;br /&gt;
Receive the secret pearls of fasting&lt;br /&gt;
Know why you should fast&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Bankas leaves footprints wherever he goes. I see Fasting Outside the Box as a written expression and extension of this pastors love for everyone he meets. Here is a book that will definitely leave indelible footprints on your heart.&lt;br /&gt;
 Bruce D. Johnson, Superintendent of Redwood Christian Schools, Castro Valley, California.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fasting Outside the Box is born out of a consistent life of prayer and fasting led by Pastor John. He is not theorizing about fasting or writing about a vicarious experience he has had with it. This book describes a firsthand experience.&lt;br /&gt;
 Dada A. Daodu, Special Education Teacher; Technical Assistant, Kogi State, Nigeria.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fasting Outside the Box takes the fear and mystery out of fasting and gives a clear, step-by-step understanding of how fasting can benefit you, especially in developing an intimacy with God. &lt;br /&gt;
