  <title>A Child&#39;s Legacy - Dorene Fort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Has anyone ever told you that it is completely appropriate and acceptable to be angry? To ask why? Why my child, and why my family? To feel and think that this is unfair! To say, This is unbearable! You are right. It is unbearable. You just lost your child! You may cry all the time and feel you cannot handle anything. You may be unable to cry because the pain is so deep. No one can possibly understand the depth of pain you are in and the question you ask every day, How am I going to get through this without my baby? This is the question no one else hears, but it echoes in your mind and heart at every waking moment. Everything you are thinking, feeling and saying the Fathers shoulders are big enough to handle it all. 
This life is filled with pain and sorrow. We were never promised that we would not be touched by it, but the Father does promise to be with us every step of the way. To hold us, to cry with us and to carry us through! 
There are pages at the end of A Childs Legacy waiting for you to pour your heart out onto them. What will your childs legacy be? 
These are some heart felt thoughts from those that have lost their own precious little ones and then have read A Childs Legacy. 
Its beautiful, powerful and cathartic. Your words regarding how the commitment to trusting in Gods strength and healing power is not a battle with a finite end were especially relatable to me. So often I try to categorize the birth and death of my child as something I WENT through, instead of acknowledging it is something I am GOING through. It was wonderful to read those words I have thought so many times coming from someone else. I think your words could be a service to so many grieving parents. 
-Amanda Heckelsberg Wolfe 
Its such a moving and poignant tribute to Amy Nicole and a Mothers love. You wrote straight from the depths of your heart with openness and honesty. Anyone just beginning this journey of grief can read your book and know that you understand. Youve turned something terrible into a ministry that gives others walking this path hope. I dont know if youre conscious of it or not, but the utter grief you expressed at losing your daughter shortly after birth shows the tremendous value of LIFE. How precious is your Amy Nicole and how precious is every life. Thank you for sharing your heart with us all!
