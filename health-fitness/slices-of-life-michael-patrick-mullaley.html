  <title>Slices of Life - Michael Patrick Mullaley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to capture the essence of a man in a simple recount of his life. Likewise, it would be equally impossible to reveal his trials, tribulations, and accomplishments exclusively through poetry. But together it may be possible to capture enough of a mans soul to keep him alive in the hearts of his audience for all of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his collection &lt;i&gt;Slices of Life: A Selection of Short Stories and Poems&lt;/i&gt;, author Michael Patrick Mullaley seeks to capture the full dimensionality of his existence. Through a conglomeration of memoir, poetry, and prose, Mullaley challenges the limitations of written expression and weaves a totality of insight into not only his own being, but also some deeper aspects of the human condition as a whole, exploring both weighty questions and everyday pains and pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Chair explores a moving relationship between an inmate and a little girl, and many of the stories feature a core struggle, such as that of the older runner in All the Way. Some of his poems appeal to a cerebral nature, such The Contender, while others appeal to the senses, as in Feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thought-provoking collection of prose and poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, &lt;i&gt;Slices of Life&lt;/i&gt; captures the depths of Mullaleys soul and considers questions of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
