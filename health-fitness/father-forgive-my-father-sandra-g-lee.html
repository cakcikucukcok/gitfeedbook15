&lt;P&gt;I have just completed the book by Sandra G. Lee, Father, forgive my Father. What an awesome book and life story to be told. The author shared all aspects of the history of child abuse through her eyes as a child and as an adult. More people should share as Sandra Lee has and the world would be a better place. Hats off to Sandra for being a strong and dedicated Christian to face adversity with non Christian individuals or those in denial of an eppidemic worth sharing. There should be more people such as her to keep the world in a better place.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
