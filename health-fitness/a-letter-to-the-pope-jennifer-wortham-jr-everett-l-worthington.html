  <title>A Letter to the Pope - Jennifer Wortham, Jr. Everett L. Worthington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on true events, &lt;em&gt;A Letter to the Pope&lt;/em&gt; tells a moving story of one woman&amp;rsquo;s journey of faith, love and forgiveness in the Catholic Church. Decades after leaving the Church upon learning that both her brothers had been molested by their parish priest, Doctor Jennifer Wortham feels compelled to return to it to pray about a crisis in her personal life.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
There, she experiences a profound spiritual awakening that opens her heart to forgiveness and she is called to commit her life to the service of God. &amp;nbsp;She begins a journey to become a nun, but along the way, she falls in love. She&amp;rsquo;s conflicted&amp;mdash;should she follow her mission or her heart? &amp;nbsp;As an expression of her renewed faith, she writes Pope Francis a letter, sharing her family&amp;rsquo;s painful experience, her joy at finding love, and her belief in his leadership&amp;mdash;and in response, she receives an invitation to the Vatican for an audience with the Pope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The stories intertwine on the plane trip to Rome, where her accidental seatmate listens to her conflict and offers some advice&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;find a way to do both.&amp;rdquo; His counsel takes on new importance when she discovers that he is the pastry chef at the very restaurant where she fell in love. A coincidence that he sat next to her, or a message from God?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
At the Vatican, she meets the Pope and sees his compassion and promise to reform the Church, and she returns home, ready to begin her mission ----helping others find peace through forgiveness, faith and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Letter to the Pope&lt;/em&gt; is an inspiring exploration of the Catholic Church, its meaning in modern life, and an expression of support for Pope Francis. The book also includes a unique guide,&lt;em&gt; The Path to REACH Forgiveness, &lt;/em&gt; created by Everett L. Worthington, Jr., PhD. to learn forgiveness for any type of hurt. This guide has been piloted and tested in academic circles and has proven to help people achieve a more forgiving attitude towards someone who has hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Letter to the Pope&lt;/em&gt; is the initiation of a campaign for an International Day of Healing for Victims of Abuse, Neglect &amp;amp; Violence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
