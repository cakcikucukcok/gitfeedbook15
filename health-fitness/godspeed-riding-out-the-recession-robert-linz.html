  <title>Godspeed: Riding out the Recession - Robert Linz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Godspeed: Riding Out the Recession&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the authors experience of a solo bicycle trek of over 14,000 miles around the USA. Departing from his home in Cincinnati, Ohio on Memorial Day of 2011, he returned just over a year later after promising his Dad that he would be back home in time to celebrate his 90th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing adversity as an opportunity, the journey was his response to the crippling effect of the recession upon his work as a carpenter/contractor. Renting his home and shutting down all of his expenses, he created a food and lodging budget of $15/day. Maps and smart phone were the major expenses of his experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild camping his way around the country, he shares the curious and compelling nature of how people and events showed up for him along the way. Was it simply a journey or a journey created? At the very least it became a pilgrimage that confirmed many of his core beliefs and, in subtle ways, changed others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
