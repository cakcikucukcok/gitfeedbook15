&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Into the Pure &lt;/i&gt; author Tim Nicholls shares the key to his adventures, vitality, and experiences, and he explains how he unlocked the way that led him toward an intuitive understanding of spiritual empowerment. Being open to your own intuitive mind is about being open first to the spiritual dimensionthe real you! And focusing on your inner self, feeling your bodys mindfulness, and developing meditative skills will give you the power to hear and interpret the intuitive messages emanating from within. From there, the spiritthe energy of life, the selfwill become paramount to your understanding of your being. You will discover how it can answer all things.&lt;/P&gt;
