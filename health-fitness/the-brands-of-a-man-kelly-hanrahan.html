  <title>The Brands of a Man - Kelly Hanrahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Midlife dating is hard work, but less hard if you commit to: know yourself; know what you now want in a man; and know the brands of a midlife man.
Whether it has been ten, fifteen, twenty or twenty-five years since youa midlife womanhave navigated that crowded dating sea, youre now there. Yes, it feels strange to be out there again. And it should. We are very different today, than we were back then. We are now life-educated, hardworking professionals, homeowners, and, most important: raising children.
Thats right, weve grown up.
The Brands of a Man is a midlife womans guide for re-entering the dating world, realizing that our male counterparts have grown up, too. Through extensive research and in-depth interviews with single midlife women, author Kelly Hanrahan has written this insightful, intriguing, and entertaining book that surely will resonate with womenthose in both the dating and mating game.
In The Brands of a Man, midlife men are better defined for the midlife woman who is dating again for the first time in more than a decade and, quite honestly, shes smarter, choosier, and more guarded than ever. All of lifes lessons up to this point have prepared her for finding the right brand of a man given what she now knows about herself, and them." />
