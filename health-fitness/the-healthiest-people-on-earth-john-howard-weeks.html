  <title>The Healthiest People on Earth - John Howard Weeks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&#39;ve heard it before: A healthful diet rich in plant-based foods can prolong your life. But how much could you &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;extend your time?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adventist enclave in Loma Linda, California, is America&#39;s only &quot;Blue Zone&quot; one of five regions on Earth where people live measurably longer—about 10 years more— than average, as identified by National Geographic–funded research. This Blue Zone status is thanks largely to the foods Loma Linda residents and Adventists choose eat—and the foods they choose &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loma Linda was established in 1905 by the Adventist founder and prophet Ellen G. White. Her great-great-grandson, John Howard Weeks, still lives there. He knows firsthand what it&#39;s like to fall into the rut of unhealthy habits—and to relearn how to live and eat in a healthy way. Through the teachings of his family, Weeks was able to conquer his temptations and embrace a healthy way of living. He&#39;ll show you how to do the same, no matter what your personal battle looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Healthiest People on Earth&lt;/em&gt;, Weeks shares the secrets of how anyone, anywhere, can create a &quot;Blue Zone&quot; of their own and live a longer, healthier life. A lively read full of exclusive family stories, gainful tips and tricks, happy home remedies, and plant-based recipes, this book will be your first step on the journey to a longer, healthier, more fulfilling life&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a book about religion—it is about health and happiness. It is possible to be healthy in body, mind, and spirit. Start by eating like the healthiest people on Earth.  &lt;/p&gt;" />
