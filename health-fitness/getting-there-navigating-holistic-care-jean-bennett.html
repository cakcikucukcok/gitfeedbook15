  <title>Getting There: Navigating Holistic Care - Jean Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are many books about modalities within holistic care, but there are very few that explain how to put them all together for the benefit of those searching for relief. &lt;em&gt;Getting There&lt;/em&gt; is that book&amp;mdash;it helps those with illness or pain, reclaim their health and happiness.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today our medical system is in transition from a basis in Newtonian physics to a basis in quantum physics. This is turning everything about our medical system on its head. There are those stuck in the old ways and those pushing hard for the new. This type of change brings chaos and differences of opinion. In other words, IT&amp;rsquo;S CHAOS OUT THERE! That is what this book is about&amp;mdash;helping you sort through the chaos while our world is making its transition to a fabulous new holistic care system.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting There&lt;/em&gt; introduces the tool sets through Jessie&amp;rsquo;s true story and her journey from pain to wellness.&amp;nbsp; Educational tutorials are included to help you understand &amp;ldquo;the whys and the wherefores&amp;rdquo; and provide a deeper comprehension. You will learn ways in which your body and the universe talk to you through its babbling signs; how to listen; and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many people are searching for their own &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rdquo;. What &amp;ldquo;getting there&amp;rdquo; means in this book depends on where you are. It may mean getting rid of a chronic issue or pain, getting a different job, finding peace of mind, or learning how to move forward with family dynamics. Enjoy the multitude of informational treasures inside that help people of all ages get to &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
