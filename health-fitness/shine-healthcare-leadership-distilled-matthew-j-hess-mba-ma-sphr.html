  <title>Shine! Healthcare Leadership Distilled - Matthew J. Hess Mba Ma, Sphr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Healthcare has a history of promoting employees because they excel in their clinical role. Yet
when they move into a leadership role they often lack the training to make those around them
better. Matt has the insight, creativity and tools to teach managers to become leaders who
positively impact their organizations.
Michael C. Patterson
CEO with 30 years experience with American Medical Int., Tenet, CHS, and not-for-profit
SHINE! offers a unique perspective on leadership dynamics that specifically outlines the
tools and skill sets necessary to master leadership roles. From explaining the fundamentals of
leadership to identifying and exploring the intimate details necessary for leadership growth
and development, Matt has created a complete and comprehensive guide that is a must read
for new and seasoned leaders who wish to be the best leaders they can be. In 30+ years of
healthcare management, SHINE! is the best resource available for aspiring leaders to become
great leaders no matter their area of expertise.
Dr. Ronald J. Rejzer
President of Physician Practices, Administrative Director of Hospitalist programs, and CMO for
many prominent healthcare organizations
Over my career Ive seen a major deficit in leadership training. Often the best clinical
applicant is promoted and expected to become a leader on the job. Matt has developed
a concise leadership system that provides MBA quality tools in a nutshell. I recommend the
SHINE! Leadership Academy to any facility that is seeking a cost-effective approach to better
leadership.
Tom Thompson
CFO for 25 years with HCA, Lifepoint, Epic, and other for-profi t hospitals
As a participant in the SHINE! Leadership Academy, I gained valuable insight into the
complexities of healthcare leadership which immediately translated into more confidence and
effectiveness from me and improved satisfaction from my employees.
