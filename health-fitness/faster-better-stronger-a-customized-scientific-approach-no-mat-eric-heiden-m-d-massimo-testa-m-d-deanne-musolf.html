Part II unveils a twelve-week fitness program, tailored to your needs, which will optimize your time, efforts, and results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faster, Better, Stronger&lt;/em&gt;, named one of the top ten books of the year by Disaboom.com, is highly inspiring and fun to read, with stories from Dr. Heiden at the Olympics and from Dr. Testa about helping the world&#39;s top cyclists as well as elderly and obese patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors rarely make guarantees, but Dr. Heiden and Dr. Testa are willing to guarantee this: Everyone can get better. Including you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
