  <title>Who&#39;s Really Driving Your Bus - James O. Henman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;From the first page on, readers learn that they do not have to struggle with emotional and addictive problems alone- whether the problems are related to low self-esteem, depression, anxiety/panic problems, relationship difficulties, or the gamut of addictive problems.  You can learn to recognize &lt;U&gt;who&lt;/U&gt; is really driving your emotional bus in the most difficult &quot;traffic&quot; areas of your life.  Dr. Henman invites you to sit across from him as if you were actually in a Therapeutic Coaching session.  It is an intimate experience rather than an intellectual exercise, as you are encouraged to reflect deeply on Nuggets of Wisdom about the process of change.
&lt;P&gt;He has spent the past 30 years in his psychology practice successfully coaching thousands of clients to make desired changes, while helping them build healthy self-esteem and connect with their core spirituality.  You can walk with him through key roadblocks that commonly prevent growth, and learn how to relax into making healthy changes in the present, by approaching life with &quot;No-Fault Learning&quot;.  You can learn how to recognize and change faulty Perceptual Filters that rob you of healthy power and awareness.  You can gain the tools and skills necessary to empower your own Inner Coach, as you shift from survival mode into living consciously.
&lt;P&gt;With the help of a steering committee of recovering individuals, Dr. Henamn wrote &lt;U&gt;Changing Attitudes in Recovery- A Handbook On Esteem&lt;/U&gt; (CAIR) and founded free CAIR Support Groups in 1990.  The CAIR Handbook provided the format and structure, which allowed people from a variety of different problem backgrounds to come together and develop healthy self-esteem.  The CAIR Handbook supplied the tools and resources for the free support groups.  &lt;B&gt;Who&#39;s Really Driving Your Bus?&lt;/B&gt; shares this material in the format of a Therapeutic Coaching session.
