  <title>The Power Of Why - Amanda Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The urge to question is natural for small children—just ask any parent. But few of us are aware that it is also one of the most vital tools for success. In &lt;em&gt;The Power of Why&lt;/em&gt;, Amanda Lang shows how curiosity and the ability to ask the right questions fuels innovation and can drive change not just in business but also in our personal lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weaving together the latest research with in-depth profiles of innovators from around the world, Lang explores how to harness and develop the power of curiosity. She reveals how a major retailer set out to discover what really makes men happy—and was stunned by the results. She finds out why, at one particular hospital, nurses think it’s better if they don’t wash their hands. She learns why the most common methods of brainstorming don’t actually work and discovers a new soccer ball that could change the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A book that challenges conventional wisdom and offers practical, inspiring advice, &lt;em&gt;The Power of Why&lt;/em&gt; shows how it’s possible to reignite your innate curiosity and overcome long-standing barriers—leaving you more creative, productive and fulfilled in your job and happier in your relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
