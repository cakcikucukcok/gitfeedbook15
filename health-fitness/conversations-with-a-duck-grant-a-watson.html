  <title>Conversations with a Duck - Grant A. Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;These feelings are just choices  not emotions, as you call them. Arent they, Tnarg?	
	Emotions are energies in motion. You have chosen the way in which your energies will flow. You know that was your choice.
	Remember that emotions are best not confused with compassion, understanding and the empathy procured from wisdom. This is entirely different.&lt;/i&gt;
We all feel alien and confused at times; at times we all search for a different path to happiness, one that promises more than the status quo. We feel this path must exist. Blessedly, it exists inside of each of us; by learning to ask the right questions, we will change our lives with the answers we find.
In &lt;i&gt;Conversation with a Duck,&lt;/i&gt; reverend and spiritual healer and councilor Grant A. Watson brings us an indispensible and universally accessible guide to finding joy and finding our true selves in the midst of the wild flow that is life. Framed as a candid, personal question-and-answer story between an ordinary seeker and a knowing teacher, &lt;i&gt;Conversation with a Duck&lt;/i&gt; explores with us the essence of love, peace, faith and the evolution of the human experience. Through Tnargs honest and heartfelt searching, we find our own path out of frustration, out of grief and into, finally, being able to simply trust and be." />
