  <title>Unf*ck Your Habitat - Rachel Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The perfect housekeeping guide for somebody who is overwhelmed with their mess and can&#39;t figure out how to start.&quot;&lt;b&gt; -Lifehacker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An accessible guide on how to clean for normal people.&quot;&lt;b&gt; -Livestrong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;It actually changed my life and my home; I&#39;m serious.&quot;&lt;b&gt; -Book Riot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, a housekeeping and organizational system developed for those of us who&#39;d describe our current living situation as a &quot;f*cking mess&quot; that we&#39;re desperate to fix. &lt;i&gt;Unf*ck Your Habitat&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who has been left behind by traditional aspirational systems. The ones that ignore single people with full-time jobs; people without kids but living with roommates; and people with mental illnesses or physical limitations. Most organizational books are aimed at traditional homemakers, DIYers, and people who seem to have unimaginable amounts of free time. They assume we all iron our sheets, have linen napkins to match our table runners, and can keep plants alive for longer than a week. Basically, they ignore most of us living here in the real world!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interspersed with lists and challenges, this practical, no-nonsense advice relies on a 20/10 system (20 minutes of cleaning followed by a 10-minute break; no marathon cleaning allowed) to help you develop lifelong habits. It motivates you to embrace a new lifestyle in manageable sections so you can actually start applying the tactics as you progress. For everyone stuck between &lt;i&gt;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Adulting&lt;/i&gt;, this philosophy is more realistic than aspirational, but the goal is the same: not everyone will have a showcase of a home, but whatever your habitat, you deserve for it to bring you happiness, not stress.&lt;/p&gt;" />
