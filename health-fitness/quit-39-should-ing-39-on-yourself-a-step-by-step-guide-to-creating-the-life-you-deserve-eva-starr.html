  <title>Quit &#39;Should Ing&#39; On Yourself: A Step By Step Guide to Creating the Life You Deserve - Eva Starr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you living your life according to somebody else&#39;s script? Do you make decisions based on what other people will think of you? It&#39;s time to take back the reins, and put you back in the driver&#39;s seat. You have at your disposal the map, which will guide you every step of the way. Buckle your seat belt, and hold on for your life; this isn&#39;t your ordinary self-help book.   Quit &#39;Should-ing&#39; on Yourself will take you down a road filled with twists and turns, valleys and peaks, on a remarkable journey to finding out who you really are. Japa, an African grey parrot will help you peel back the layers of the onion, revealing your true self, as you shine the light on the darkness ready to explore areas where you dared not tread before.   You&#39;ll laugh, you&#39;ll cry, and you&#39;ll fall in love with Japa, as he leads you through a mixture of life&#39;s realities in a world filled with so much insanity. You&#39;ll find a sense of connectedness as you blossom into the flower you were meant to be." />
