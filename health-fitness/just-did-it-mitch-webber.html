  <title>Just Did It! - Mitch Webber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having tried just about every diet since the invention of elasticated trousers, joined every fitness club within strolling distance of the pub, and spent a small countrys GDP on personal trainers, Mitch Webber was somewhat disappointed to find himself fifty years old and technically obese.
With no desire to transform his physique into that of Connan the Barbiturate and without wanting to become a food-bore (one of those people who spend more time investigating the ingredients of a meal than enjoying the company), Mitch decided to see if there was a way to make some tolerable adjustments to his lifestyle in order to get back into reasonable shape.
Just Did It! is the result of those successful efforts. 
It is an easy guide to adjusting your lifestyle, a bit, in order to start to lose weight over time. It offers guidance on how to get into running, how to get a good workout down at the park, and how to eat sensibly four days a week in order to be able to enjoy social eating on the weekendsincluding a wee bit of social drinking too.
The book covers
	an exercise program,
	a program to get you jogging, and
	an approach to sensible eating. 
Its a programme that you can do. Its a reasonable approach that doesnt require you to become a monk or a self-righteous vegan for the next fifteen years. It understands real life, real people, and the real reason we havent been able to succeed with other dietshuman nature and the attraction of every decent chef and cookery programme on the TV.
So if you have looked sadly at a recent group photo, thinking that it was about time that you took a few steps towards reducing your girth, then this is the book for you. You can do it. It doesnt have to be hell. Just decide to make a difference, buy the book, and get on with it. Just do it! 
Lets hope you think the same as Mitch. Take his advice, hes been there, read it, bought it, and most importantly, done it. So get moving, take control of your health, shed some weight, get fit, live life, hopefully a long life, and just do it.
