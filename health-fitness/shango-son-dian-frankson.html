      <meta name="description" content="Shango Son is not your traditional Love story. It is a sense tingling depiction of the love between a mother and son, as the pair tries to find themselves in the midst of ancestral misperception.  Athena the main character is an African American woman born in the era of revolutionary hip hop to a multi-cultural afro-Caribbean family. Athenas Caribbean blood line runs deeply in her veins however growing up in Brooklyn NY USA has made her foreign to her roots. Her addiction to her teenage love gave life to a son, the realities of parenthood and the consequences of lust in addition to the formation of another cultural identity.  As life forces Athena to address her roots she finds that the story of the slave brings her Caribbean and American cultures together causing her to realize that her lack of knowledge about her history has disturbing consequences. Athena struggles with her sons needs as Tim stumbles blindly through a lack of self-affirmation into his own manhood.   In the end the love between the two has made them spiritually connected in a way that supersedes death." />
