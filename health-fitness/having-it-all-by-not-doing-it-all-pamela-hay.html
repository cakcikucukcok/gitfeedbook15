  <title>Having It All by Not Doing It All - Pamela Hay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being a woman today means a thirty-year rollercoaster ride. Professional women have been trying for decades to do it all at home and in the workplace, while still receiving less domestic support from their husbands than needed. The competing obligations and second-shifting leaves women with too little time and space for nurturing their own needs and exacts a heavy price on their wellbeing over time. 
Women have learned how to lean in. Have they learned how to lean back? The effort to be superwoman is burning them out. There are better ways to lessen the load and stress. This book draws attention to the second-shift phenomenon and offers women better life strategies that can bring more joy, energy, fulfillment, and fun into their lives." />
