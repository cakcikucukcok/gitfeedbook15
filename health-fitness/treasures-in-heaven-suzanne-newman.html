  <title>Treasures in Heaven - Suzanne Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Treasures in Heaven will bring a tear to your eye. A testimony of one womans heart ache and triumph through her battles with miscarriage. This book is a complete must for all, men and women alike  old and young as it brings validation of  the deep suffering that is often experienced through loss. The book confronts us with the reality of Gods incredible ability to love and reach the very depth of our being in His time and way, offering an amazing understanding of Gods uncanny ways to bring healing, deliverance and release to those seemingly forgotten and uttermost parts of our soul.  Suzannes life-changing testimony is sure to break your heart but will also inspire and challenge you to your very core, as she open-heartedly shares the resolve of her painful journey through miscarriage which has led her only to discover a revelation of the intensity of His great personal favor and choice of her, unveiling an amazing privilege and honor. You will not be able to put this book down  it will grab you from the start and lead you on to a victorious celebration. This book does the talking and the ministering. It is an effective tool and a critical read for everyone who has experienced or been effected by loss and the pain of miscarriage. Only God alone has the power to unlock and minister to our deepest sorrows and this testimonial does just that. It will open your eyes and open your spirit to a greater knowledge of the ongoing power, saving grace and love of Jesus Christ and ministry of the Holy Spirit in and at work through His Body. You will be not left the same." />
