  <title>The Noticer Returns - Andy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perspective is a powerful thing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Andrews has spent the past five years doing a double take at every white-haired old man he sees, hoping to have just one more conversation with the person to whom he owes his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a chance encounter at a local bookstore, Andy is reunited with the man who changed everything for him – Jones, also known as “The Noticer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds, Jones uses his unique talent of noticing little things that make a big difference. And these “little things” grant the people of Fairhope, Alabama, a life-changing gift - perspective. Along the way, families will be united, financial opportunities will be created, and readers will be left with powerfully simple solutions to the everyday problems we all face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the lens of a parenting class at the Grand Hotel in Point Clear, Alabama, Jones guides a seemingly random group to ask specific questions inspired by his curious advice that “You can’t believe everything you think.” Those questions lead to answers for which people have been searching for centuries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do we begin to change the culture in which we live?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the key to creating a life of success and value?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What if what we think is the end…is only the beginning?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What starts as a story of one person&#39;s everyday reality unfolds into the extraordinary principles available to anyone looking to create the life for which they were intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
