  <title>Free Your Mind and Your Life Will Follow - Lisa L. Wilcoxon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The search for true happiness and our own authenticity is one of our deepest and most natural inclinations, yet the majority of us spend our entire lives never having found the answer to these questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What is my purpose? These questions seem so simple, yet they are extraordinarily difficult to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does living authentically really mean? If we could wake up tomorrow and be our authentic selves, who would we be? What type of things would we do? In what ways would our lives change? What would it take to make you happy with your life? It doesnt matter if youre rich or poor, young or old, or all things in between. The truth is that the majority of us are dissatisfied with our current states of living. This is because we are not being authentic with ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for us to&lt;/p&gt;
	discover how our minds work; &lt;br&gt;
	learn how we create our reality; &lt;br&gt;
	enlarge our vision; &lt;br&gt;
	find our true selves. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We struggle daily seeking out ways in which to make our lives reflect who we feel we are, while striving to survive, but who are we really? Who are we as individuals with individual consciousness? As a member of a society that shares a collective consciousness, who are we? Its time to seek out the new youthe true you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
