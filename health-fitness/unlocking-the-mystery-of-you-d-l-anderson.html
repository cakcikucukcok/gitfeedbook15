  <title>Unlocking the Mystery of You - D. L. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Without purpose there can be no fulfillmentand although we can surely live without fulfillment, we will scarcely feel alive.
Every one of us has a purpose in life and an array of life offices which we were destined to fulfill. Fulfillment, then, must come via the realization of our purpose and our designated offices. Therefore, seeing as we can not find fulfillment following any other course, D.L. Anderson has dedicated this leading composition within his Pinnacles of Life book series to analyzing the ins and outs of purpose, and revealing how living a life of purpose is the first step in securing fulfillment and ultimately fulfilling our destiny.
To assist each purpose seeker in this crucial endeavor, D.L. Anderson has formulated a progressive roadmap which he has labeled as, The Pinnacle of Purpose, a series of 7 unique steps which have the power to progressively transform each purpose seeker into the man or a woman they were destined to be while living the life theyve always imagined. Thus conclusively, if you are ready to walk the path dedicated to your purpose, you should know that this book was written with you in mind. As such, the pages within this composition will lead you to the place where you will find the fulfillment you seek." />
