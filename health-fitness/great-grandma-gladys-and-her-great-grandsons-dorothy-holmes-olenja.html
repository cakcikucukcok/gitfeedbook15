  <title>Great Grandma Gladys and Her Great Grandsons - Dorothy Holmes-Olenja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lets embark on a journey to the beautiful coastal city of Beaufort, SC. Its a city where cutlure comes
to life and the history is as thick as the Gullah-Geechee accents. Here the people are as warm as the weather and family values are not forgotten, but passed down from generation to generation. Th is is
the setting in which we fi rst meet the wise and loveable matriarch, Great Grandma Gladys.
Great Grandma Gladys embodies all of the characteristics that we treasure and love in a matriarch.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is a teacher, a nurturer, and of course a great cook! She is the thread that holds the family together
and the person who gives advice to you when you need it the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this story, the Summer has just begun and Great Grandma Gladys is pleasantly surprised to find out that all of her Great Grandsons are coming to town for a visit. This presents the opportunity
for our matriarch to do what she does best. She knows that her Great Grandsons are always hungry,
always full of energy, and of course always asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Great Grandma Gladys is put to the test when one of the boys ask her a very important
question. She knows that the way she answers will have a great impact on their lives, so she must use
her wisdom as a teacher and guide to steer her Great Grandsons in the right direction.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Great Grandma Gladys as she guides her Great Grandsons on the topics of spirituality, culture,
and history. Th is story provides lessons of value for all ages, so read, remember, and enjoy!&lt;/P&gt;
