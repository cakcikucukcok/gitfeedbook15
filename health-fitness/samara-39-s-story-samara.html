  <title>Samara&#39;s Story - Samara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Join the author as she travels back over 2000 years to visit with a miraculous woman in the holy land. Open the door and walk into a world where people are more connected to the land, to nature, and to God. Explore a time where people didnt separate their religious beliefs from their daily lives. Awaken and explore the rituals and the richness in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story follows the life of Samara as she grows up in her Uncle Binyamins house on the road to Jerusalem after losing her mother when she was just an infant. Her cousin Joshua surreptitiously affords her the opportunity to obtain something few women of that time had; an education. Equipped with knowledge, a strong connection to God and a very inquisitive mind, Samara defies the odds and leads a most extraordinary life; especially for a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age when women were subservient to men Samara disregards convention and becomes a strong, independent woman. But this is more than just the story of Samara. This is a modern day parable meant for all WOMEN (and the men who care about them). Even today women still struggle with the tension between their more traditional, child-raising, supportive roles and the modern, liberated, successful, leadership roles that are now permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, come along with Samara on a profoundly moving, deeply inspiring walk back in time. Partake of this divine mystery and allow yourself to be inducted into the deeper mysteries of who we really are. May the light that shines through Samara illuminate your own life and reveal your own true path. If something deep within you begins to stir honor it. If not just sit back and enjoy the story. Either way, it will take you somewhere you have never been before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
