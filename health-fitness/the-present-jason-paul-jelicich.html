  <title>The Present. - Jason Paul Jelicich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;When is the last time that you did &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; for 10mins? Not readingnot watching TVnot even thinking?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For many this seems an impossible feat. Life is just too busy. We have become so consumed by our work, smartphones and gossip that we have lost touch with our natural selves. This disconnection is the root cause of much of the pain we suffer, a pain that arises from our resistance to what&lt;i&gt; is&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You likely have been thinking about doing something about this for a while now, knowing that your current trajectory leaves little left in the tank for self-care. Like most of us, you have experienced that feeling of restlessness that keeps your mind whirring, even in moments of repose. The world just keeps on getting faster, and you find yourself struggling to keep pace, to stay on top of things, to stay centred.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Present&lt;/i&gt; is written for people just like you. It is a laypersons guide to mindfulness, offering insights and practices on how to be less tangled up in your thoughts about the past and/or future  and become more present. After all, when you are present you are happy, in fact, its impossible to be happy and not to be present!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Youre bound to get at least one idea that resonates with you and sets you on a path towards more peace and contentment in your life. Perhaps the best news of all is that it can happen right here, &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
