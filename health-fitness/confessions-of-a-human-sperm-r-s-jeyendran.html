  <title>Confessions of a Human Sperm - R.S. Jeyendran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Throughout history, mankind has wondered about its origin - where he came from and how he got here.  Where did I come from? is one of the first questions our own children ask us.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But the real question should be What are mankinds building blocks?  For posteritys sake, the answer is sperm!  Rather than giving the female egg all the credit, as is usually the case, lets shine the light on this silent, unsung hero  the sperm  shall we?  So to the question What came first, the chicken or the egg? we can unequivocally state Who Cares!  Because without sperm, there would be no question to ask now, would there?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Being the author and merely a man, I thought it more apropos to go to an actual source for the truth.  So to that end, I found one who will walk and talk you through all you need to know about sperm, including things you never knew were possible along with those amazing things you might have heard but wondered if they were really true.  And even though you are a human and will be getting your story from a human sperm, s/he will even throw in tidbits about some of your animal friends for comparison purposes.  So, come and meet the little guy who will tell you all you need to know. &lt;/P&gt;" />
