  <title>Do You Love Football?! - Jon Gruden, Vic Carucci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jon Gruden asks his Tampa Bay Bucs, &quot;Do you love football?!&quot; it&#39;s to remind them why they pull on their shoulder pads every Sunday morning. It&#39;s not about the money or the fame; it&#39;s about their passion for what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And passion is something that has fueled Gruden&#39;s entire career. From his college playing days and his climb through the coaching ranks -- from college to assistant coaching jobs with the NFL&#39;s elite teams, to his first head coach job with the Oakland Raiders, and finally, with the Tampa Bay Bucs -- his meteoric rise is unparalleled. Underneath it all, though, he&#39;s just a humble, hardworking, no-nonsense guy who has no hobbies: &quot;I&#39;m not a scratch golfer. I don&#39;t know how to bowl. I can&#39;t read the stock market. Hell, I have a hard time remembering my wife&#39;s cell phone number. But I can call &#39;Flip Right Double X Jet 36 Counter Naked Waggle at 7 X Quarter&#39; in my sleep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in this motivational memoir, Gruden provides insight into what makes him tick. &lt;em&gt;Do You Love Football?!&lt;/em&gt; is an intimate look at his life as a player, coach, and head coach, as well as the principles that have made him the hottest coach in the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;" />
