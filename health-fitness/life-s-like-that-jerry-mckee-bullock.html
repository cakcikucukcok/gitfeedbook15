  <title>Life’S Like That - Jerry McKee Bullock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lifes Like That was born when I was having trouble getting clients at the Family Counseling Center. That is a fancy name that came from my family counseling career. I thought I needed to get some ads in the local newspaper. That led to my meeting Mr Rowe Ray, the managing editor of the San Marcos Daily Record. I simply wanted to explore possibilities but ended with an invitation to write a weekly column for the newspaper. 
I can honestly say I never broke my word on confidentiality; i.e., everything we talked about stayed in the Center, everything that is except the funny things. I was counseling with a game warden that told me about a lady who was losing a sheep a night to one old hungry coyote. Whenever the warden came out, she would start feeling sorry for the coyote and asked the warden not to shoot it. Finally she had five sheep left. She called the warden and once again told him she wasnt ready to have him hunt down the coyote. The warden looked at the little flock of sheep and said, Mrs. Jones, whatever you say, but weve only got five more days anyway. As you read this book there will be tears and sunshine. The good news is you dont have to sit down and read it all at once. Life Really Is Like That." />
