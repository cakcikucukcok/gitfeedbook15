Outdoor play with a lot of kids and indoor things with a few children are covered. Being unplugged does not necessarily mean doing physical activities, so quiet activities are also exploredfrom kids songs to nursery rhymes and prayers. There are even a few arts and craft activities, but that would be another book in itself! Have fun learning, sharing, or revisiting things that you might have done growing up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
