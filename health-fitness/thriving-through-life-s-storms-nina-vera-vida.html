  <title>Thriving Through Life’S Storms - Nina Vera-Vida</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered if youll have the strength to face and overcome all of your lifes countless hardships? Are you tired of being tired, anxious, and worried? Does fulfillment seem like a farfetched dream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see more of yourself than you like in these questions, dont despair. What could be a life-changing experience awaits in Thriving through Lifes Storms. Nina Vera-Vidas escape from war-torn Bosnia at seven, was just the beginning of a life filled with hardships. Nina endured dehumanizing deprivation and abuseas well as the loss of her sight to a brain tumor. But what makes Nina a true survivor is that she never gave up. She created a path to rise above it all to inspire others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She developed coping mechanisms to minimize the pain and subsequent scars. What she has since realized is that there are two types of barriers to happiness. External hardships are often random, caused by things, people, or circumstances beyond our control. Internal hardships, on the other hand, are self-inflicted. As we wrap ourselves in the veil of denial we obscure the hardship triggers, making these internal hardships hard to detect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to face down your enemiesboth internal and externalas Nina has, a new life of fulfillment, freedom, and success can be yours. The ascent wont always be effortless, but it will be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stop living when we give up, when we let lifes hardships make us feel helplessly stuck in the abyss of stagnation and discontent. Keep in mind Ninas motivation for writing this book: never give up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
