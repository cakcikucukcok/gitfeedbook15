  <title>Win the Crowd - Steve Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Would You Like to Become More Commanding, Convincing, And Charismatic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, Steve Cohen, master magician and star of the long-running Chamber Magic show in New York City, will reveal the secrets of all great showmen and magicians&amp;#8212;how to persuade, influence, and charm, and ultimately accomplish the things you&#39;ve always wanted to do. As Cohen writes, &quot;You&#39;ll discover how to take over a room, read people, and build anticipation to a feverish pitch so people are burning to hear what you have to say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Win the Crowd&lt;/em&gt; will teach you Steve Cohen&#39;s Maxims of Magic, simple rules you can use to take charge of practically any situation, from on-the-job disagreements to dating to important cocktail parties. The Maxims of Magic will wash away insecurities and hesitations, and replace them with confidence, poise, and leadership. What&#39;s more, Steve Cohen will show you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to Create a Magic Moment. Capturing people&#39;s imaginations and attention so they listen carefully to every word you say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to Command a Room. Showing everyone in the room that you are speaking right to them, making them all feel unique&amp;#8212;and completely focused on you.  &lt;li&gt;How to Read People. Learning to sense what people are feeling and thinking as you speak, what they want from you, and how to make them feel like they are getting it. &lt;li&gt;Misdirection. The most important trick in all of magic&amp;#8212;getting inside people&#39;s heads, and directing what they are thinking at every minute.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you strip away the sleight of hand tricks, magicians are essentially masters of attracting and holding attention and impressing audiences, exactly the psychological secrets you need to be successful in life and business.&lt;/p&gt;" />
