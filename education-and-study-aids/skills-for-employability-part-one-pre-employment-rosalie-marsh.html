  <title>Skills for Employability Part One: Pre-Employment - Rosalie Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Further titles in the new Lifelong Learning: Personal Effectiveness Guides by Rosalie Marsh, which draw from her extensive skills &amp;amp; industrial experience in sales management, and work-based learning in adult and further education. It is a step in the personal and professional development journey where development of the whole person is at the heart of Marsh&amp;#39;s ethos. Currently there are approx. 1 million people in the UK who are &amp;#39;Not in Employment, Education, or Training&amp;#39; (NEETS). In addition, there are adults and young people who are pre-employment, in employment and looking to enhance their careers or are between jobs. Many do not have the life skills and /or a basic understanding of what is required to become and stay employed and enhance their future. This book - one of a series - will provide essential information to fill the gaps identified through research and enhance the prospects of a successful interview. In two parts, Skills for Employability - designed to be read in bite-sized chunks - will focus on some of the skills you need in order to impress an employer, stand out from the rest, become employed, and enhance your future. Part One looks at the Pre-Employment skills needed. Part Two looks at what you need to know when you move into employment. Features of Skills for Employability Part One. Each chapter details the Learning Outcomes and relevance to other qualifications such as Functional Skills. At the end of each topic, there will be a series of short practical activities for self assessment for learners to see how far they have &amp;#39;travelled&amp;#39; in gaining knowledge and understandin. In turn this will add to a sense of achievement. Much of the content will feed in to the Entry Level or Level 1 / 2 Awards and Certificate in Employability and Personal Development, Personal Life Skills, Employability Skills and in particular SSA 14.1 Foundations for Learning and Life &amp;amp; 14.2 Preparation for Work, and Functional Skills; all of which are linked to the Qualification Credit Framework (QCF). All content will relate to the current gaps in knowledge&amp;amp; understanding and softer skills for those who are pre-employment e.g. school leavers; 16-18 year old unemployed; returners to work; learners with disabilities who are seeking a change of employment; in employment and seeking to enhance their prospects or between jobs. The book is lavishly illustrated to enhance text. There are links to websites e.g. for legislation. This provides more interaction and variety for the learner and ensures currency. Adult Literacy and Numeracy is not be addressed in this book as there are many excellent books available. Benefits: After completing Skills for Employability Part One, readers will: Have more awareness of the standards of behaviour and requirements of employers Have completed short practical activities, which aim to test their understanding. Have raised their self-esteem and confidence. Have an awareness and understanding of the business environment. Have some basic knowledge and understanding, which could be presented for accreditation of prior learning for City &amp;amp; Guilds Awards/Certificates in Employability and Personal Development, vocational qualifications, or company training programmes. What people say: What people say: &amp;#39;A highly effective trainer, coach and assessor who strives for excellence in everything she does. Her knowledge of work-based learning and adult education is outstanding and she offers good support to those she teaches and mentors, particularly through drawing on her own personal experience as an adult learner.&amp;#39; Andrew Ellams, MD Ellams Associates Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;" />
