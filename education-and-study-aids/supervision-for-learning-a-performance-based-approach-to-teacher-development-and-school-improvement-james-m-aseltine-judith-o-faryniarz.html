  <title>Supervision for Learning: A Performance-Based Approach to Teacher Development and School Improvement - James M. Aseltine, Judith O. Faryniarz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods of supervision and evaluation focus on teachers&#39; inputs: their lesson plans, instruction, and classroom management practices. But what matters most is the outcome they achieve: &lt;i&gt;learning&lt;/i&gt;. This book introduces Performance-Based Supervision and Evaluation (PBSE), a data-driven and teacher-directed approach proven to build educators&#39; analytical and instructional capacity to address the learning needs of their students. It&#39;s a move away from disconnected annual goals and outside-in improvement initiatives, and toward the full integration of teacher evaluation, strategic professional development, and school improvement planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supervision for Learning&lt;/i&gt; is an important resource for school leaders looking to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Honor the judgment of teachers while targeting student performance in areas of essential knowledge and skills articulated in standards;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Empower all teachers to use performance data as the basis for instructional decisions and monitor the effectiveness of these decisions through action research;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Develop meaningful collaborative relationships with and among teachers; and&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Acquire authentic evidence of teacher and student growth.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors James M. Aseltine, Judith O. Faryniarz, and Anthony J. Rigazio-DiGilio explain the best-practice foundations of their approach and provide guidelines for its implementation. Sample artifacts and illustrative vignettes bring the PBSE process to life, clarifying the supervisor&#39;s role, the teachers&#39; responsibilities, and the students&#39; gains. You&#39;ll also find a planning and monitoring tool that maps milestones within the development and evaluation cycle, along with strategies for reconciling this approach with district reporting requirements and budget realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This product listing is for the reflowable (ePub) version of the book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
