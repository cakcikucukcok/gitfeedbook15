  <title>From the Civil Rights Pioneers to the First African American President and Beyond - Darryl Lezama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book From The Civil Rights Pioneers to The First African American President and Beyond is a description of some significant events that have impacted our culture in negative and positive ways. The negative aspects of some of the events in the book, is indicative of the kind of destructive behaviors that project some of the worst aspects of our culture people and nation. Nevertheless, as stated by our president regarding race relations, injustice, violence, and crime in general in America, we are better than this we must summon our better angels as we interact with each other. The book in a sense is a challenge for us to examine the negative so that we can change those painful experiences into moments of learning and enhancing our attitudes and treatment of each other regardless of our national heritage, ethnicity, cultural differences, economic status, educational and professional backgrounds, and racial differences. The book is a brief description of experiences that we should not just ignore since many of our great leaders have sacrificed so much to make sure that our nation fulfils its responsibility to all American citizens in terms of Justice, equality, civil rights, and full access to achieving the American dream as we all pursue freedom and the accomplishment of our God ordained dreams. The book is also describing how much progress we have made towards achieving the dream of Dr Martin Luther Kings dream of justice and civil rights for all Americas regardless of race." />
