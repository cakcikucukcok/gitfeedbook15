      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ultimate Price &lt;/em&gt;details incidents in which Police Officers have lost their lives on duty in Australia. From the first recorded death of Police officer, Constable Joseph LURKER who was murdered in Sydney in 1803,&amp;nbsp;cut down by a criminal wielding a cutlass, the book follows the growing&amp;nbsp;State and Federal Police Forces &amp;nbsp;and the events where the officers have been killed in the execution of their duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author recreates&amp;nbsp;the feeling of&amp;nbsp;the incidents by putting the reader there, at the location, be it the sticky&amp;nbsp;heat of the&amp;nbsp;tropical north, the dry winds of Central West NSW or the bone aching cold of Tasmania, the author paints a picture so&amp;nbsp;the reader can see and almost feel what his happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incidents vary from stabbings, shootings, vehicle accidents, drownings, suicides&amp;nbsp;along with&amp;nbsp;many more violent,&amp;nbsp;terrifying and in some cases mysterious deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public are grateful for the work their Police Force do, but how many of them are aware of the terrible dangers those officers face every time they show up for work. The Ultimate Price shows the reader the realities faced by their Police every day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
