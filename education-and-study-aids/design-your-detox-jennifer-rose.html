  <title>Design Your Detox - Jennifer Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a report of the findings of many years of research and experimentation from various communities worldwide working with natural, drug detox methods. From October 2014 through April 2016, the members of the Facebook group &#39;Welcome to Heantos&#39; conducted a public, nonclinical trial in which organic detox products from around the world were tested on addicts. Participants were detoxing from a range of substances such as heroin, prescription pain medication, prescription anxiety medication, methadone, suboxone, methamphetamines, amphetamines, cocaine, crack, alcohol, and nicotine. Social media created a communication platform for people across the globe to share information and experiences, the good and the bad. This book is an accumulation of the findings from the experimentation, designed to be a guide for learning how to detox yourself or someone else naturally. There are a range of products and methods used, so it is important to read the entire book before designing your detox. This book is meant to be a resource for which you can plan and execute your detox, doing it as quickly or as slowly as you need to meet your specific needs. These methods are discreet, manageable, affordable, and designed to meet the needs of a modern-day addict. They can be used short- or long-term and can also be used for preventing and coping with relapse and cravings. In this book, I will be sharing the successful components of this eighteen-month nonclinical trial where more than seventy-five people detoxed themselves naturally, most with severe, long-term addictions. I will walk you through the process of preparation, detox, and designing an aftercare plan. My hope for this book is to help lead people out of the darkness of addiction and into the light of reconnecting with the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
