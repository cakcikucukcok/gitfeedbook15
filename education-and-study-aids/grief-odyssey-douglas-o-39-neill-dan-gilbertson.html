  <title>Grief Odyssey - Douglas O&#39;Neill, Dan Gilbertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A must-have book for anyone who has experienced the loss of a beloved wife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief Odyssey is the story of two men, each of whom lost his wife to cancer. Both had young children and both went to the depths of sorrow before they began to find a sure emotional footing for their life. This is a must-have book for those who have experienced the loss of a loved one or who has someone in your life who has also dealt with loss. Dr. Douglas E. ONeill and Dan H. Gilbertson take you on a journey that details: &lt;br /&gt;
- The shock they experienced as a result of learning their wives had a terminal illness &lt;br /&gt;
- The way they reacted to their wives illness &lt;br /&gt;
- The life-changing decisions they had to make before and after the wives treatments &lt;br /&gt;
- And the way fathers and their children adjusted to their tragic losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their journey is expressed in four phases: &lt;br /&gt;
1. Receiving the diagnosis of cancer &lt;br /&gt;
2. Watching a wife suffer through treatment &lt;br /&gt;
3. The unbelievable loss and sorrow when she died &lt;br /&gt;
4. Recovering slowly from that grief to find, once again, emotional health&lt;/p&gt;" />
