Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking is an illustrated cookbook written by Samin Nosrat. The book shows a new way of cooking into just four elements. Nosrat is teaching everyone from kids in the middle school to skilled professional chefs to cook using Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat. Nosrat believes that Salt enhances a dish&amp;#39;s flavor, Fat carries flavor and creates texture, Acid balances the flavor in a recipe, and Heat determines the food&amp;#39;s texture. The book explains how to make the cooking right and why a person should be doing it in the right manner with any ingredients at any time it is wanted.&lt;br /&gt;
Samin Nosrat&amp;#39;s Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking was published on April 25, 2017, by Simon and Schuster. It became #1 at New York Times Bestseller and #1 at Amazon&amp;#39;s Cooking, Food, and Wine Reference category.
