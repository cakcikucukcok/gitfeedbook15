  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Travis Stork’s The Lose Your Belly Diet - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Travis Stork’s The Lose Your Belly Diet: Change Your Gut, Change Your Life includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: The Lose Your Belly Fat Diet: Change Your Gut, Change Your Life by Travis Stork is a primer on the benefits of diversity in the human microbiome. In layman’s terms, this is known as good gut health. Scientific knowledge about the human gut is rapidly evolving. But at its center lies a basic truth: diversity in the microbiome is closely connected with good health. Whether or not you want to lose weight, choosing to organize your diet around the principles of good gut health will result in a happier, healthier life. 
The microbiome consists of microbes (otherwise known as “Little Buddies”). Microbes are all sorts of things, most of which people frequently mistake as bad for you—viruses, fungi, and (most of all) bacteria. The population of microbes in your gut is unique to you, but generally speaking, the more the merrier. It’s ideal to have a mix of many different kinds, a concept known as biodiversity." />
