  <title>Techniques &amp; Strategies: to Increase Parent Involvement - Ann A. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the main interests in this book focuses on how to persuade parents
to get engaged in their childs education. Many authors have studied this
evidence that shows this to be an excellent opportunity, for a parent to visit the
classroom teacher... The more involved parents are the more they help the
academic achievements of their child. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book gives the most suggestions of how to get parents interested in spending
time in their childs school and classroom. Also it shows results of how to work
with parents and to keep their interest in the schools. My interpretation of these
methods stated in my book is the best approach to increase parent involvement
and be successful. The Parent Community School Connections Committee was an
important part of decreasing the educational gap between students." />
