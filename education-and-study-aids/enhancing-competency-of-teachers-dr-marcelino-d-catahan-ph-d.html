  <title>Enhancing Competency of Teachers - Dr. Marcelino D. Catahan Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enhancing Competency of Teachers is a fundamental teaching-and-learning guide. Its main goal is to learn and develop an enhanced value system (EVS) and practice it in everyday life. Filipinos are known worldwide for being friendly and hospitable. However, without limitations, these traits become the roots of corruption in all sectors of Philippine life.
This book outlines the sequence of logical modules in teaching-and-learning enhancement programs (TLEP) in the school settings. It is designed for learners in all educational levels, to enhance competencies and effectiveness in human resource development and training. It contains concepts, principles, and strategies for effective teaching and learning. The Ethico-Moral Theory in Learning provides five sets of significant rules in learning ethicomoral values to become genuine professionals. Verily, the skill, method, and social competencies of a person are not enough. They must be supported by a quality EVS that will guide the person to think, feel, and act-with strict reverence to the will of God. 
Many books contained different insights, theories, philosophies, principles, and concepts in teaching and learning that sometimes confused readers in understanding how to learn or teach productively. In contrast, this text is presented in a very simple and logical manner. It advocates for the need of educational change, using EVS as the key. It presents simple approach in designing, implementing, and managing TLEP in school settings. It covers elementary modules-i.e., Learning Process; Teaching Methods/Techniques/Strategies; Preparing Daily Lesson; Sequence of Instruction; Selection of Teaching Aids; Speech Techniques; Questioning Techniques; Learning Distractions; Evaluation Techniques, Review/Summary/Reinforcement. Verily, a high school graduate can become a very productive professional through reading this book seriously. 
Today, the main cause of poverty is corruption. Poverty creates hunger. Hunger results to crimes. Criminal acts are indicators of degraded ethicomoral values. To have More Fun in the Philippines, EVS is a must amongst Filipino people!" />
