  <title>The Five Defective Teachers and Staff - Alvin Allen, Dominique Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to Websters definition, defective means something or someone not operating normally or properly. A teacher is a person who provides education for all students. 
In this book, we examine the classroom practices of five different types of teachers. We focus on the newbie, the veteran, the boastful, the international, and the unorganized teacher. These teachers work in a dysfunctional school environment, and they have attributes that need some improvements to help the school run smoother. 
As an educator, you will be prone to relate to each of these teachers. You may even have encountered one of them before or even been one of them. You will also be able to take advantage of the strategies implemented to help them become successful instructors in their classroom and school unit. 
With that said, get comfy and follow along as these teachers enhance their craft. The Five Defective Teachers and Staff incorporates and provides research-based strategies." />
