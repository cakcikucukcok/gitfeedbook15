  <title>Teaching Students with Learning Disabilities at Beacon College - William Nesbitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Teaching Students with Learning Disabilities at Beacon College &lt;/EM&gt;is a collection of essays written by professors and learning specialists (educational support personnel) at Beacon College, an accredited four-year institution for students with learning disabilities, ADHD, and other learning differences. The purpose of this book is to help fill the massive gap in the literature on teaching students with learning disabilities at the college level. The attrition rate of students with learning disabilities at traditional colleges and universities is very high. With a 70% four-year graduation rate, Beacon College is well-positioned to be an instructional model for other institutions. The essays discuss institutional practices, alternative teaching strategies, and personal instructor experiences.&lt;/P&gt;" />
