  <title>Understanding and Developing Theological Education - Bernhard Ott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Historically education has been driven from behind  - the history, and above  - the educational institution. Traditions and adherence requirements have led to inflexible models of school leadership that are focused on administration and rife with educational politics. In contrast, today&#39;s theological landscape needs institutions with a grassroots-driven educational system, looking to a future that is biblically and theologically grounded. This publication, an English translation from the original German focuses on the leadership and curriculum development required for such a paradigm shift. Ott comprehensively assesses trends in current theological education across the world with detailed reference to wider trends in global tertiary education. Written primarily for those in leadership roles at theological schools and training institutions, this handbook is an essential resource for equipping the next generation of leaders in theological education." />
