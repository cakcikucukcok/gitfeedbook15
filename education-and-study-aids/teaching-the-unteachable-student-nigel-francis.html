      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to deal with challenging students? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of students who repeatedly skip class, rarely hand in work, and always have plenty of attitude when you attempt to correct their behaviour. Do you at times feel like pulling your hair out and simply giving up? Well dont throw in the towel just yet. &lt;i&gt;Teaching the Unteachable Student&lt;/i&gt; will provide you with strategies to help you overcome challenging behaviours in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book goes beyond traditional classroom management techniques; it is a book dedicated to reshaping your students character. Ultimately, for students to be successful, they must develop Six Key Elements of Character that include:
Respect, Responsibility, Perseverance, Caring, Citizenship, and Trustworthiness. As you use the strategies in this book to inspire these core traits in your students, you will find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   a renewed passion and confidence in your teaching;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; an ability to connect with your students and build genuine relationships;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; a significant improvement in your students academic progress and overall character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready to do the unthinkable by Teaching the Unteachable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
