  <title>When the Cops Come Knockin&#39;: An Illustrated Guide to Criminal Law - Trinity T Townsend, Travis T Townsend</title>

legal process. Many everyday citizens just don&amp;rsquo;t have that access. More and more people from all backgrounds, income levels and culture&amp;nbsp;are finding themselves in unanticipated encounters with the law. Some of their&amp;nbsp;decisions that lead to encounters with law enforcement are calculated, but many of those decisions are uninformed (or misinformed) and they end up crossing the line of legality unknowingly. They find themselves on&amp;nbsp;wrong side of the law because they don&amp;rsquo;t have the right information. &lt;em&gt;When the Cops Come Knockin&amp;rsquo; &lt;/em&gt;breaks down barrier of criminal law literacy, the elements of criminal offenses, and knowing your rights,&amp;nbsp;and grants access to knowledge of criminal law to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY THIS BOOK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law can be overwhelming and intimidating&amp;mdash;leaving everyday people ignorant of its ins and outs. Legal mumbo jumbo with terms like &amp;ldquo;omission,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;provocation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;willful blindness,&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t resonate with non-legal experts with everyday citizens. But while the understanding of these terms is uncommon, the impact of their meanings is very common, and ignorance of the law is no defense to severe punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the Cops Come Knockin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; fills the void where good decent people who do not work within the justice system&amp;nbsp;need user-friendly and culturally-relevant information about criminal law, presented in a format that makes the law practical and accessible for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THIS BOOKS UNIQUE APPROACH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented in a comic-book style,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;When the Cops Come Knockin&amp;rsquo;: An Illustrated Guide to Criminal Law&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is complete with a cast of relatable characters and written in everyday urban prose. The book positions serious content and &amp;ldquo;true to life&amp;rdquo; situations with the very real, life-altering consequences of landing on the wrong side of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book features scenarios, language and reasoning that meets readers on&amp;nbsp;their terms, presented in a way that is unconventional, but effective for ease of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT READERS WILL LEARN SPECIFICALLY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers can expect to gain legal clarification, discover practical tips, obtain expert legal perspective and view examples regarding&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;the most common and the least-known criminal law issues&lt;/strong&gt;, including such points as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What your rights are and how and when to assert them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What you can do to defend yourself against criminal charges.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who the players are in the criminal justice system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to avoid accidentally committing serious crimes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to avoid illegal police searches and arrests.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to properly ask for a lawyer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to avoid getting blamed for the crimes of your friends, associates, and family members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to deal, and more importantly how NOT to deal, with police officers in law enforcement situations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
