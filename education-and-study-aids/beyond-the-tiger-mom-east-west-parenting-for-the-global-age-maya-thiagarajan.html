Why do Asian kids do so well in math and science? What is the difference between an Asian upbringing and a Western one? Why do some Asian mothers see themselves as &quot;tiger moms&quot; while others shun the label? How do Asian parents deal with their children&#39;s failures? Is it sometimes good for children to fail?&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These are just a few of the compelling questions posed and answered in this fascinating new parenting book by educator Maya Thiagarajan as she examines the stereotypes and goes beneath the surface to explore what really happens in Asian households. How do Asian parents think about childhood, family and education&amp;#151;and what can Western parents learn from them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Through interviews with hundreds of Asian parents and kids, Thiagarajan offers a detailed look at their values, hopes, fears and parenting styles. Woven into this narrative are her own reflections on teaching and parenting in Asia and the West. Thiagarajan synthesizes an extensive body of research to provide accessible and practical guidelines for parents. Each chapter ends with a &quot;How To&quot; section of specific tips for Asian and Western parents to aid their child&#39;s educational development both inside and outside the classroom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
