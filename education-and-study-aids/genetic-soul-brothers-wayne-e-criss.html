  <title>Genetic Soul Brothers - Wayne E Criss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Genetic Soul Brothers is an adventure into a human unknown. It is a story about a baby boy being carried by and born to four different women in four different places at the same time, and raised separately by these mothers. The/se baby/s has/have the same identical genes and share a common or multi-soul. As the child/ren grow/s and has/have dreams of an identical youth playing in non-recognizable settings, he/they begin/s to realize that he/they is/are one of four IDENTICALS. He/they each grow/s up in very different environments, develop professions, marry, and have children. Eventually, after a long, difficult, and frustrating quest which includes a unique night time spirit/soul communication, they find each other. 
     As they learn how they came to be, four identical quadruplets from four different mothers, the question arises: should they take the culprit fertility clinic to court for causing this tragedy?  they are giant freaks. Should they do nothing; or should they sue the clinic for big money and become famous, which would certainly disgrace their parents and friends. If they reach a four family agreement concerning anonymity or notoriety, but before the final decision is implemented one or more dies or is killed, then what happens to their common soul, or are there partial souls? Where does/do it/they go? Is there a waiting area near heaven or hell for partial souls? Is it possible that all of these &#39;lives&#39; and &#39;arrangements&#39; are totally controlled by soul maestros? And if so, why and how do they do this?" />
