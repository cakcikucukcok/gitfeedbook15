  <title>Immigrant and Refugee Students in Canada - Courtney Anne Brewer, Michael McCabe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recent immigrants and refugees — both children and their families — often struggle to adapt to Canadian education systems. For their part, educators also face challenges when developing effective strategies to help these students make smooth transitions to their new country. 
&lt;p /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Immigrant and Refugee Students in Canada&lt;/i&gt;, researchers join educators and social workers to provide a thorough and wide-ranging analysis of the issues at the preschool, elementary, secondary and post-secondary levels. By understanding these issues within the unique Canadian context, educators can work more effectively with newcomers trying to find their way. 
&lt;p /&gt;This book pursues three lines of inquiry: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the main challenges that immigrant and refugee children and families face in the Canadian education system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the common aspects of successful intervention?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn from the narratives of researchers, educators, social workers, and other frontline workers who work with immigrant and refugee families?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
