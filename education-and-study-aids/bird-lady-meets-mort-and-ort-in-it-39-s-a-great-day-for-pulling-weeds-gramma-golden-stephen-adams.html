  <title>Bird Lady Meets Mort and Ort in &quot;It&#39;s a Great Day for Pulling Weeds&quot; - Gramma Golden, Stephen Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this tender and fact-filled story, Bird Lady is the one being taught to recognize her careless gardening practices by none other than a pair of unusually attractive and vividly colorful birds, Mort and Ort Aahkamort.  
One soggy spring morning while weeding her garden, Mort and Ort suddenly appear.  At first, she ignores what she thought to be a gravelly voice since by looking around she could not see anyone.   She shrugged it off and continues to weed when suddenly she hears the voice again.  This time, she sees a kaleidoscope of color on a pair of unusually tall birds.  Sitting atop the weather-worn shed directly behind her, they were talking to one another in words Bird Lady could completely understand.  
At first, she is both startled and a bit fearful when the larger one in his gravelly voice begins to talk directly to her by saying &quot;It&#39;s a great day for pulling weeds!&quot;  She begins to lose some of her fear as a result of looking into their exceptionally large fawn brown eyes.  It isn&#39;t until a short time later when Ort holds out her right wing and gently hugs Bird Lady&#39;s left leg that the fear disappears and friendship begins.  The lessons that follow throughout the rest of the story result in Bird Lady changing her gardening practices to help wildlife visitors thrive in her gardens.  
Like the author, Bird Lady has a passion for birds, butterflies, flowers, plants and nature in general.  She would rather be in her gardens spending time enjoying her natural surroundings than any other place.  As a result of the lessons Mort and Ort teach Bird Lady, children and adults alike reading this book will learn how to help birds, flowers, butterflies and insects thrive as they visit their own gardens." />
