  <title>The Applica-Phobia of College Admissions - P. J. Finer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are preparing to apply to colleges and universities in the United Statesyou need this book!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
College is one of the most expensive investment students will make. Therefore, helping students find the right college for them not only makes for happy students, but helps parents feel more confident about the result. College is not only a big decision that students have to make, but it is also the foundation of their future success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Students and parents are discovering that schools that a few years ago were considered second- and even third-tier schools have elevated their standards significantly. With substantially more students applying, and in some cases fewer spots available, for the select colleges across the country, schools are demanding higher grades and have higher test score criteria, which seemingly place college out of reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The applicant pool changes annually, thus nothing is carved in stone as to which students are accepted and which are not. However, the best chance of getting in to the school of your choice is to display your passion as to where you are headed in life, starting in 9th grade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
High school seniors and college transfer students know how difficult it is to get into the top-tier colleges today. Creating a persuasive, eye-catching application requires creativity, foresight, and a marketable presentation as to what you can offer that will attract schools. That is why the process has to start with a resume.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The student applying to college today must show schools why they are different from every other student applying. If you showcase your abilities through the development of a talented resume and a strong essay, admissions committees will have no choice but to fall in love with you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Students must figure out how best to present themselves to admissions committees; difficulties arise when students begin feeling anxiety, their parents begin applying real or perceived pressure, and the student crumbles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Applica-phobia of College Admissions: Why Getting in Starts With Your Resume is a how-to guide for students navigating the Applica-phobia of the application process. Oftentimes students dont know where to start, and the entire experience becomes overwhelming. This book offers a program that assists students by mapping out the plan that will best suit them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book addresses how to explore your talents, skills, and aspirationsto create a picture of who you are; how to identify the schools that are right for you; how to determine which type of application to submit (early action vs. early decision, binding vs. non-binding); exercises to help determine what you can bring to a college or university that will create interest; ideas for essay topics, a step-by-step guide to writing a college application essay, and sample essays to get your creative juices flowing; techniques you can use in the interview to convince admissions committees you are the right candidate for their schools; how to put your summers and out-of-school time to beneficial use (with internships, jobs and/or community service); and more.
Students who fall under The DREAM Act and Student Adjustment Act will have an opportunity to understand this favorable bi-partisan legislation and the benefits it offers them and their communities. This section also includes a listing of various grants, loans, and scholarships for which students can apply.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Colleges and universities across America have one goal: to get the best students that fit within their ideals, thoughts, and personality. Your job is to figure out what those components are and how you fit inand this book will help you." />
