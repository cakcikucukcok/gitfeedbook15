  <title>Move off the Grid - K.K. Yadhunath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This thought-provoking book is about the use of solar energy at our home. It is about a solution to the countrys most urgent problempower shortage. The book details basic principles, usage, and current development and growth of solar energy in India and around the world, with add-on chapters about other renewables, climate change, energy efficiency, green buildings, electrical vehicles, etc. We are proud to present this first-of-its-kind book to be published in India. Even though a few publications in the subject are available today, most are pure technical for a niche segment. This book is now unique in India with its broad range of interesting subjects of mass appeal related to deployment of solar energy, its importance in our daily life, and other related topics and happenings. 
The introductory chapter of the book looks into the history of solar energy. The next couple of chapters get more specific on solar energy and its usage. The amazing range of products that work on solar energy, which gives us an alternative to grid power, is briefed here next. The next section of the book talks about climate change, its impact on our ecology, and an exhaustive list of organizations working to combat climate change. This is followed by the solar energy utilization around the world. 
Indias power requirements is then followed by the status of solar power in India, the aggressive action plan of the government of India, a serious look on why to minimize the use of grid power, and then tips for selecting and installing the right solar system for your use. The wonderful concept of the worlds first carbon-neutral city comes next, followed by a chapter on the importance of energy efficiency. The world of renewables has an astonishing range of power-generation techniques, and this is detailed in the next chapter. This is followed by the chapter on green buildings. The main book comes to a landing with a chapter on one of the most promising conceptelectric vehicles. 
This book on contemporary science and its imminent use is a well-thought-out and prepared collection of useful information for every discerning reader to enjoy reading and improve his/her knowledge on the subject." />
