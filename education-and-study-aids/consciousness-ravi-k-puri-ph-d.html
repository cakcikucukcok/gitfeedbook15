  <title>Consciousness - Ravi K. Puri Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Consciousness: The Ultimate Reality explores all aspects of consciousness. It is a well-written, well-researched work that I find unique in that it delves deep into the subject while still being easy to understand. That combination is difficult to accomplish and Dr. Puri has done an excellent job. I highly recommend this book; its well worth the readers time (Elizabeth Davis, Newspaper columnist and freelance editor, Boonville, MO).
A very insightful perspective on consciousness. A marvelous explanation portraying the subtleties of consciousness that is comprehensive and very easy to understand. A reading for a soul-searching, hungry world (Cynthia Neff, Columbia, MO).
Consciousness is a very complex subject and has always baffled me. The book is an eye opener for me. I am blown away by the expression of the author. Very simple, comprehensive, well written, amazing insight. A read that will stay with you a life time. A mind stretched can never go back to its original form. Captivating (Lisa McKinzie, President/CEO of McKinzie &amp; Company, Osage Beach, MO).
This thought-provoking, beautifully written book has deep, rich insights on higher truth and its relationship with consciousness. It serves as an inspiration for those ready to begin their quest on the path of self-knowledge. A fascinating and clearly annotated study. Not only is Dr. Puri a deep thinker but also a deep knower (Linda Castillon, Director of the Transcendental Meditation Program, Maharishi University of Management, Fairfield, Iowa)." />
