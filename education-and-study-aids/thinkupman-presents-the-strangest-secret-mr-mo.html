  <title>Thinkupman presents: The Strangest Secret - Mr. Mo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a sobering statistic: by the age of 65, on average only 5% of us will have achieved success. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, right. . . &amp;rdquo; you might say, &amp;ldquo;Success is subjective; there is more than one version of what it means to be successful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of this book disagrees with you. Along with Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, and all the other billionaires on earth. Here is the absolute, best definition of what it means to be successful: success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, success is when an individual who knows what they want to do works towards achieving their dream. That sentence alone gives you clues into the strangest secret on how to achieve a life of prosperity and success. The key is setting a goal, creating a plan to achieve said goal, and following through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Earl Nightingale, who in 1941 was aboard the USS Arizona during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Mr. Nightingale was just one of the fifteen surviving Marines. This experience, combined with the maxim &amp;ldquo;As ye sow, so shall ye reap,&amp;rdquo; inspired Mr. Nightingale to embark on a new path, anchored in the philosophy that each of us becomes what we think about. We become what we think about--is an idea that has echoed through the ages, from the Bible to preeminent thinkers of today. Despite this, most of us choose to ignore this precept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THINKUPMAN introduces &lt;em&gt;The Strangest Secret&lt;/em&gt;, rewritten in a fun and easy-to-understand way for modern audiences, whether they&amp;rsquo;re in their high school years or golden years. With fun and insightful illustrations, comic strips, and everyday English, audiences new to this inspiring and penetrating totem as well as those familiar with the text will be pleased at this entertaining and life-changing slender volume, as presented by THINKUPMAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever thought, &amp;ldquo;life is so unfair!&amp;rdquo; this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to stop waiting for luck to happen, and instead get out there and pursue the favorable circumstances you desire, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to think with positivity and focus to realize your goals, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to rise above mediocrity and become the person you want to become, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to, at age 65, look in the mirror and say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a success!&amp;rdquo; then this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for everyone, because all of us at one point or another have complained about our circumstances, blaming &amp;ldquo;bad luck&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fate.&amp;rdquo; We often ask why others achieve so much and work half as hard, while we achieve so little? The difference of course is that those 5% took The Strangest Secret to heart and lived its philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple, yet positive book will show you how to seize each day and create a life of fulfillment and success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
