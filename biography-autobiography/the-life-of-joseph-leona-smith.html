  <title>The Life of Joseph - Leona Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is dedicated to all Gods people in the world, big and small. Its an action packed story, from the beginning to the end. It can be Enjoyed, by a wide range of ages. Adults will really enjoy, reading this Story to children. Theyll love the drawings that bring to life, this true Bible story. Children will naturally love it, with all of its characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I took special care, in keeping the story, as explained in the bible, by telling the story in a way, that children can understand it, more fully. I was inspired to create these, life like pictures, of the characters, in the story of Joseph. I wanted their to be as many pictures as possible, to keep the attention of a child, and also, make the story come alive, for them. The pictures describe the action, love, joy and sorrows of this marvelous story of Joseph and his family. It tells how God came lovingly through, for not only Joseph and his family, in the time of a famine, but also how, the whole world was then saved, from starvation, by Gods wisdom, given to Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Joseph endured, in times of great stress, trials, sorrow, rejection, and disappointments. When all the world, was to have, a deadly famine, the Lord showed Joseph a way, to save people, all over the world, by saving a little, each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Josephs family, did make mistakes, that was not good, but God caused all things to work together for their good, and the worlds good also. Though all was not good, that happened to Josephs family, yet, God had a great plan, in bringing them, out of their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
