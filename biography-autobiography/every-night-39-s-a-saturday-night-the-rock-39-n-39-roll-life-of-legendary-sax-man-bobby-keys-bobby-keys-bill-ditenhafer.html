  <title>Every Night&#39;s a Saturday Night: The Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Life of Legendary Sax Man Bobby Keys - Bobby Keys, Bill Ditenhafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Born in Slaton, Texas, Bobby Keys has lived the kind of life that qualifies as a rock &#39;n&#39; roll folktale. In his early teens, Keys bribed his way into Buddy Holly&amp;#8217;s garage band rehearsals. He took up the saxophone because it was the only instrument left unclaimed in the school band, and he convinced his grandfather to sign his guardianship over to Crickets drummer J.I. Allison so that he could go on tour as a teenager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keys spent years on the road during the early days of rock &amp;#145;n&amp;#8217; roll with hitmakers like Bobby Vee and the various acts on Dick Clark&amp;#8217;s Caravan of Stars Tour, followed by decades as top touring and session sax man for the likes of Mad Dogs and Englishmen, George Harrison, John Lennon, and onto his gig with The Rolling Stone from 1970 onward. &lt;I&gt;Every Night&#39;s a Saturday Night&lt;/I&gt; finds Keys setting down the many tales of an over-the-top rock &amp;#145;n&amp;#8217; roll life in his own inimitable voice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Augmented by exclusive contributions with famous friends like Keith Richards, Joe Crocker, and Jim Keltner, &lt;I&gt;Every Night&#39;s a Saturday Night&lt;/I&gt; paints a unique picture of the coming-of-age of rock &#39;n&#39; roll.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
