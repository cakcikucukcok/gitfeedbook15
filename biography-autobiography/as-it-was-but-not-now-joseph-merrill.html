  <title>As It Was … but Not Now - Joseph Merrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1923 in Andalusia, Alabama, twenty-odd miles north of the Florida line, a physician was born. Its a place deep in the piney woods that was an area of sand beds, sand roads, and sandspurs. In &lt;I&gt;As It Was  But Not Now&lt;/I&gt;, Dr. Joseph Merrill tells his story that began in that little town more than ninety years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Merrill recalls a boy educated in the public schools of the rural South who was transformed into a physician. NIH and Baylor College of Medicine provided him an environment to study the vagaries of academic medicine in Americas changing health care industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with anecdotes and stories from his youth to his college days in medical school to his career as a physician, Merrill offers a look at the life of a doctor and the ebb and flow of the practice of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
