  <title>Citizen Washington - William Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He became the nation&#39;s first hero. ...But before that, George Washington was just a man. And in his youth, he was a man on the make. He wanted to serve the king, so he donned a red coat and fought the French. He loved another man&#39;s wife but yearned for status, so he married a rich widow. He dreamed of wealth, so he accumulated land and slaves. He accumulated enemies, too... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Citizen Washington&lt;/i&gt;, one of those enemies--a newspaper publisher named Hesperus Draper--learns that Martha Washington has burned her husband&#39;s letters at his death. So Draper sets his nephew on a quest to find the truth about the letters and about the man himself.  The younger Draper meets a dozen people, from Mount Vernon slaves and Iroquois Indians to Jefferson and Adams and the other giants of the era, and they tell their own stories as they tell Washington&#39;s: from his callow youth, through the harrowing battles of the Revolution, to the first American presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What emerges is a remarkable, multi-faceted portrait of a society reeling toward rebellion, a nation rushing to be born, and a man rising to greatness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
