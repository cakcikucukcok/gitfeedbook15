  <title>Not on My Watch! - Monica Boyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Many people curse the darkness and complain about what is wrong in society, without providing any light. Monica Boyers story is different. Not on My Watch is the story of one mom who saw her country falling apart at the seams and felt she had to do something about it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Monica was simply living her life as a middle-class mom, in middle-class America. One day while driving in her minivan, she happened to glance into her rear view mirror. In it, she saw the four little reasons to become involvedthe precious children God had given to her. That day, the headlines seemed daunting, the future was unclear, and those four children meant so much to her. She suddenly realized she had to do whatever she could to pass on an America that was no less great than the one that was passed on to her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For the past eight years, Monica has been actively involved in the political process, serving as a watchdog for family values and protecting the sanctity of life. Three years ago, she accepted the commitment to protect freedom by becoming a leader in the TEA Party movement. As she explains in Not on My Watch, with passion for her God, a commitment to country, and the burning desire to safeguard her family, she is committed to continuing to fight at the local, state, and national level.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not on My Watch is not so much about remarkable talent, or even being at the right place at the right time. Its about hearing the call, and having the courage to stand when the world around you seems to be crumbling.&lt;/P&gt;
