      <meta name="description" content="Clarissa is a teenager born to wealth and privilege. She has experienced a freedom few teenagers ever get to enjoy. She has decided to publish a fairly loosely structured set of insights in the form of this book. She has had sexual experiences most people would envy, and a few less than desirable ones Clarissa hopes this book will be read by teenagers, however she fears it will only be made available to adult readers due to what she views as censorship and slavery.  We must warn the reader that it is sexually explicit. It details Clarissa&#39;s sexual adventures. Some of these she pursued actively. Some of these she found herself having without being quite sure how she had ended up in them. But this is not just a book for &#39;perves&#39;, as she herself would call many readers, with the greatest affection and approbation. It is also a book for thinkers. In fact it is for people who tend to think about life, and sex, and not just blunder their way through both." />
