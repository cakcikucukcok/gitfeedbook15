  <title>Planet Paradise and the Law of the Jungle - Morris Haimowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the memoir of 94 year old Morris Haimowitz, co-author of several books with his wife of 57 years, Dr. Natalie Reader. In these pages Dr. Haimowitz tells the story of his life, from the orange groves of Florida to witnessing the bombing of Iwo Jima, from selling shoes for five dollars a week to calming race riots in Chicago, from recycling army uniforms and airplane boxes in Hawaii to evaluating schools, economic, informational and medical systems.
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Morris served in the US Airforce for four years where he received the bronze star medal. He taught community organization at the University of Chicago, 
was director of human relations at Chicago board of education during the race riot years of the 1960s, and taught on Chicago public television for 10 years. 
He served as board member of the international transactional analysis association for 11 years, while teaching transactional analysis internationally for 30 years.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Throughout his book, Dr. Haimowitz recounts the politics and dynamics he witnessed while working closely with students, teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, police, as well as patients, and colleagues.
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Currently, Morris gardens, runs on his treadmill, studies nutrition, and writes poems for his three daughters and five grandchildren." />
