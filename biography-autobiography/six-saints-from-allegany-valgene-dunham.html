  <title>Six Saints from Allegany - Valgene Dunham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are special areas of Gods green earth in which each of us has been given the opportunity to develop into our full potential. This book presents the natural resources for agricultural endeavors in Allegany, New York, as such a locality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six farm girls were raised by godly parents, leading to their acceptance of Jesus Christ as their personal Savior and exhibiting Gods love to their families and the community. A short biography of each relates their childhood on the farm, their education, their preparation for service to God and the community, and the training of their children in the ways of Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonfictional, devotional stories include major tragedies in which the everlasting arms of Gods grace upheld each woman while theyre suffering great loss. Each story is supplemented by supportive scriptures, poetry, Christian quotations, and personal testimony concerning Gods instructions in his Word and the resulting joy of obedience. The book illustrates how one family, the authors ancestors, dedicated to serving God, has been able to be more than conquerors over four generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
