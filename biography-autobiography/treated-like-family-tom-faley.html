  <title>Treated Like Family - Tom Faley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;At the age of nineteen, high school diploma in hand, Leonard Gentine knew two things: he wanted to own a family business that would pass from generation to generation, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Dolores Becker, a girl he&#39;d met on a blind date.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For Leonard, life didn&#39;t prove that simple.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This biography, told from the viewpoint of four generations of the Gentine family, places the reader in Leonard&#39;s shoes as he advances from young man to old age and discovers life&#39;s foundational lessons. Along the way, he endures outstanding debts, disappointments, and a collection of small businesses, all with Dolores at his side. It&#39;s an inspirational story of perseverance, personal integrity, and a mind-set of always doing the right thing-as painful as that may be in the short term.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;TREATED LIKE FAMILY&lt;/b&gt; details the development of Sargento-a nationally recognized cheese company and household name. At the same time, it&#39;s a timeless story that showcases the importance of the individual and how a family united in a single purpose within the right culture is unstoppable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tom Faley invites the reader into the lives of the Gentine family and the men and women they hired, deftly weaving a story grounded in over 180 interviews-the collective voices of the company&#39;s employees, retirees, and friends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;TREATED LIKE FAMILY&lt;/b&gt; offers a rare glimpse into the creative mind of an innovator and entrepreneur and underscores the rewards for all of us when we maintain our humanity toward one another: When one person motivates others to pull together, at times facing unspeakable odds, he is able not only to change their lives but to alter history.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
