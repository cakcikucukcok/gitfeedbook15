      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “HOW TO PICK STOCKS LIKE WARREN BUFFETT: Profiting From the Bargain Hunting Strategies of the World’s Greatest Value Investor” by Timothy Vick&lt;br&gt;Warren Buffett is an investor with one of the world’s best track records: Timothy Vick has researched his strategies, and presents the reader with Buffet’s four principles, which have been consistently profitable across year of investment and stock market turmoil. These four principles are: 1. Have a street-smart investment philosophy. 2. Analyze all potential investments astutely. 3. Avoid getting into loss situations religiously. 4. Obey the general rules of good investment strategy. &lt;br&gt;Vick takes each strategy, and breaks it down into guidelines that are easy to understand and follow: plan on staying actively involved in making investments for 30-years or more, so that you look at the market with a long-term view; only buy stock that will increase in value by at least 15-percent per year; value a business solely on its future earnings, discounted for risk; devote at least part of your portfolio to unconventional investments which guarantee a specified return. Never buy or sell anything just because of fashion.&lt;br&gt;In short, Warren Buffet’s philosophy is to invest for the long-term, sustainable gains. Use knowledge, stay with your strengths and ignore daily fluctuation. This is a must-have book for the savvy investor.&lt;br&gt;" />
