  <title>Ask a Pro: Deep Thoughts and Unreliable Advice from America&#39;s Foremost Cycling Sage - Phil Gaimon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil Gaimon&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Ask a Pro&lt;/i&gt; answers every question you&#39;ve always wanted to ask about pro cycling...sort of. &lt;/b&gt;Gaimon gathers the best of his popular Q&amp;amp;A column-and pokes fun at his younger self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the howling protests from his peers, no one&#39;s ever been more willing to spill the beans on what it&#39;s really like inside the pro cycling peloton than the sarcastic scribe Phil Gaimon. Building on the outrageous success of his hilarious 2014 debut, &lt;i&gt;Pro Cycling on $10 a Day: From Fat Kid to Euro Pro&lt;/i&gt;, Gaimon gathers the absolute gems from his monthly Q&amp;amp;A feature column in &lt;i&gt;VeloNews&lt;/i&gt; magazine into his new book, &lt;i&gt;Ask a Pro: Deep Thoughts and Unreliable Advice from America&#39;s Foremost Cycling Sage&lt;/i&gt;, adding a dose of fresh commentary and even more acerbic and sharp-eyed insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With six years of material to work with-including his incredible rise into the pro ranks, the devastating loss of his contract for 2015, and his bold return to the Big League-Gaimon covers every possible topic from the team dinner table to the toilet with plenty of stops along the way. Gaimon offers wise-ass (and sometimes earnest) answers to fan questions like: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· How much chamois cream should I use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· I&#39;ve started shaving my legs. How can I be accepted by my friends?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· What do you do to protect yourself when you know you&#39;re about to crash?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· How many bikes does my husband really need?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· What&#39;s the best victory celebration? Do you practice yours?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· In women&#39;s cycling, what is the proper definition of a pro?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· What do you say to someone if they honk or almost hit you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Do you name your bikes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· What do pros think when they see a recreational cyclist in a full pro kit or riding a pro-level bike?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Can you take your bike apart and put it back together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· How bad does the weather have to be to call off a training ride?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· How do you know when it&#39;s time to change a tire?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· When you&#39;re in a breakaway all day, do riders form a future friendship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Riders keep complaining about &quot;unsafe&quot; weather at races. When did pro cyclists turn into such wussies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· How do the pros define a &quot;crash&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaimon wields his outsider&#39;s wit to cast a cock-eyed gaze at the peculiar manners, mores, and traditions that make the medieval sport of cycling so irresistible to watch. &lt;i&gt;Ask a Pro&lt;/i&gt; includes new resources from Gaimon, too, including his Cookie Map of America, dubious advice on winning the race buffet, a cautionary guide for host housing, Phil&#39;s pre-race warm-up routine, and a celebrity baker&#39;s recipe for The Phil Cookie. &lt;/p&gt;" />
