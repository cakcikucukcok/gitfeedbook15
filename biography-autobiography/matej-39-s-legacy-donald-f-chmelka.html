normal&#39;&gt; Legacy &lt;/i&gt;is a nonfiction chronicle following the author&#39;s Czech
family through 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century history.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;It is a sequel to &lt;i style=&#39;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&#39;&gt;Matej&#39;s Journey
to America &lt;/i&gt;that creatively traced the &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Chmelkas&lt;/span&gt; to
biblical times, and then journeyed with them through six millennia from
present-day Iraq, to the Czech Republic, and finally to America. The author&#39;s
great-great-grandfather was born as the &lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;Rocky&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;
 &lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;Mountain&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; fur trade boomed in 1825,
and grew up on a 13-acre farm in &lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Moravia&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;
where the &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Chmelkas&lt;/span&gt; had been serfs since Charlemagne
was crowned the first Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Gold, homesteads and &lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Texas&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;
longhorns lured thousands of oppressed Europeans to &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
in the mid-1800s, riding on steamships and railroads that now made
long-distance travel feasible. &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Prussia&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
established its European dominance in 1871 when railroads closed by war
reopened to civilians, allowing Matej to flee his beloved motherland for a free
homestead in &lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Nebraska&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He found a difficult life on the prairie with
grasshoppers, drought, hail and fires destroying crops&amp;#8212spurring his 14-year-old
son to join a Texas cattle drive and then to dodge Indians and gunfighters
throughout the romantic era of the Wild West. Matej died in 1902, leaving his
family little wealth, but a legacy, the first 100-years of which is covered in
this book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Henry Ford, the Wright brothers,
Thomas Edison and other inventors were creating a &lt;st1:place&gt;New World&lt;/st1:place&gt;,
and the Czechs finally found independence thanks to World War I, which put an
end to feudalism but gave birth to Communism. Technology in transportation,
agriculture and communications continued to expand during the Roaring Twenties,
and a Democratic America became the hope to millions still victimized by brutal
dictators. Good times gave way to the Great Depression and the author was born
on a primitive &lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Nebraska&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; farm as a
new war spread around the globe. &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Germany&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
and &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Japan&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; were
brought to their knees, but the world was introduced to nuclear horror and was
soon threatened by Russian, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese
Communists&amp;#8212ungrateful allies vowing to bury American Capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The &lt;st1:place&gt;Middle East&lt;/st1:place&gt;
and &lt;st1:place&gt;Africa&lt;/st1:place&gt; were now freed from European colonialism, but
instead of developing natural resources for the benefit of their citizens,
rival leaders wallowed in tribal warfare.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Israel became the incendiary target for Muslims who controlled much of
the world&#39;s oil, now in great demand as the automobile and airplane gave new
mobility to man. As the world&#39;s leader, &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
became its policeman, taking on one evil empire after another. &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Korea&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
and &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Vietnam&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
were not proud moments, yet Communism fell to economic demands that only
Democratic Capitalism could meet.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The &lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;Czech&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;
 &lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;Republic&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; and the entire Russian
Bloc were suddenly free, but as the world relaxed, a war of terror began,
financed by Arab oil and executed by Muslim extremists. Outmatched in
technology, failing regimes retreated to guerilla warfare, determined to
outlast a culture softened by instant gratification. &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Lebanon&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;,
&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;Palestine&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;,
&lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; and
&lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; became
major hotspots while &lt;st1:place&gt;Africa&lt;/st1:place&gt; simmered under tribal
warfare with millions dying from AIDS and starvation. &lt;/p&gt;

the world events of the past 100 years with the Chmelka family story, including
the author&#39;s journey from farm boy to engineer and executive in the automotive
and aerospace industries.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He retired in
1997 and began writing a two-volume epic, concluding in 2003 when the &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;United
  States&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; remained the world&#39;s primary
protector; but sadly, often criticized and hated by cynics and political
opportunists. American immigrants are generally grateful for the opportunities
and freedom our great country offers, and many of the &lt;span class=GramE&gt;world&#39;s&lt;/span&gt;
downtrodden continue their desperate journeys to our shores. Others jealously
preach hatred and death to &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;,
but as descendants of those who sacrificed much to be here, let us never forget
our legacy. &lt;/p&gt;
