This &lt;I&gt;Companion&lt;/I&gt; offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is &quot;the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked &lt;I&gt;memoir.&lt;/I&gt;&quot;&lt;BR&gt; Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well asfor the lay reader.
