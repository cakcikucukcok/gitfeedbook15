  <title>It&#39;s My Story - I&#39;ll Tell It My Way - James M. Wahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Story is a refl ection on the events of my lifefrom my birth in 1926 until my
marriage in 1949, at the age of 23. My experiences in growing up on a poor, hilly farm
without electricity or inside plumbing during the depression years of the 1930s, then the
diffi cult war years of the early 1940s, followed by the growing prosperity after WW II
all helped to shape the kind of person that I wished to become. These events helped me
to progressively establish three main goals for my life: Build a meaningful relationship
with my Creator, get a worthwhile education, and fi nd a Special Girl to share my life.
In those 23 years, I accomplish two of my goals. The one remaining goalmy fi rst and
oldest objectivewas still a work in progress at the end of My Story. My efforts to
fi nd an acceptable way of worshipping my God would not be realized until a few more
years had passed. I had also determined that my Special Girl and I would reach this
goal together. If time allows, I will complete that account in Our StoryAll the Way
in the near future.
My initial purpose in writing this account has been to preserve that heritage for my two
sons, Steve and Jeff, and for their families . . . If My Story proves to be of any interest
to others, so much the better.
