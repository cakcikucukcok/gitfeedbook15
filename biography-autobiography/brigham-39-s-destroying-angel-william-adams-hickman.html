  <title>Brigham&#39;s Destroying Angel - William Adams Hickman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the autobiographical account of Bill Hickman, Chief of the Destroying Angels, Head Danite, etc. After Mr. Beadle began to examine the history of the Mormon church; and while all the Mormon people spoke of Bill Hickman as a desperately bad man, and guilty of untold murders, he was struck by two curious and then unexplainable facts.&lt;br /&gt;
The first was that while everybody, from Brigham Young down, united in calling Hickman a murderer, and while evidence could easily be collected of several of his crimes, not a single attempt has been made by priest or people to bring him to justice. The second point is that long after Hickman was known as a murderer, he was successively promoted to a number of offices; he was Sheriff and Representative of one county, Assessor and Collector of Taxes, and Marshal; and during all this time he was on terms of personal intimacy with Brigham Young.&lt;br /&gt;
