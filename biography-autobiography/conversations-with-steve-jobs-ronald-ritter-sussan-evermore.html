  <title>Conversations With Steve Jobs - Ronald Ritter, Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I asked Steve what he would want to be remembered for.“I want to be remembered for placing a tool in the hands of people and giving them the power to access all the information in the world and make a future how they want it. This is my legacy.”
Steve did not conceive the iPhone and iPad with a mandate of how to use them. He simply placed the tool into your world at the gentle stroke of a finger. It is a precious gift from a Hippie of love and enlightenment to the rest of the world.
 Where did the source of the visionary come from? How did he actually conceive the idea for iPhone and iPad technology? 
He also leaves us with a future prediction for technology. A device which stares at us in the face so simplistic in its presence that it may have been overlooked. But its simple design underlies complex technology that could become the biggest income earner in the history of Apple.
Well simply, let’s ask Steve." />
