  <title>Michael Jackson and Women - June Forester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Jackson&#39;s sexuality has always been a controversial issue which often degenerated into a media spectacle, leaving hardly enough space for other aspects to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was alive, he was considered either as an androgynous or an homosexual character who could not be attracted to women in any manner whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his death, he became all at once a highly sexy heterosexual object, sometimes described as a womanizer : actresses, singers, supermodels, princesses or mere fans, all claimed that they shared intimate moments with the King of Pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an attempt to unravel the truth behind more than three decades of allegations. From his childhood to his death, he avoided doing things like anybody else and his relationships with women were not an exception to the rule. Both intricate and exciting, Michael Jackson&#39;s love life has something of an &quot;epic&quot; and often challenges the mere triviality of facts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
