  <title>Conversations with Cayce: Edgar&#39;s Grandson, Charles Thomas - Sherry Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charles Thomas Cayce was an ordinary kid who liked baseball and fishing and hanging out with his friends. He had little interest in the accomplishments of his late grandfather, the renowned psychic Edgar Cayce, and as he grew older, his parents&amp;#39; involvement with the Association for Research and Enlightenment became a source of embarrassment. Why did they have to be into such weird stuff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attitude changed when he looked at the life reading his grandfather had given for him just hours after he was born. It spoke of the kind of person he would be, as well as events that nobody could have known about in advance. His &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;family had been right all along. But that led to a different conundrum. If Edgar Cayce had been capable of predicting major developments in Charles Thomas&amp;#39;s life, did that mean he had no control over his own destiny? What if he wanted something different for himself than the reading laid out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conversations with Cayce: Edgar&amp;#39;s Grandson, Charles Thomas&lt;/em&gt; chronicles Charles Thomas&amp;#39;s journey from indifferent skeptic to president of the A.R.E. If you&amp;#39;re a seeker yourself, you&amp;#39;ll be fascinated by Charles Thomas&amp;#39;s musings on his famous grandfather, his own otherworldly experiences, and his unique contributions to the Cayces&amp;#39; work.&lt;/p&gt;" />
