  <title>You Can Issue It, but Can You Take It When It Comes Back to You? - Maya Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maya Sanders has had enough drama to last a lifetime. For too long has Maya withstood the slings and arrows of those close to herher aunts, uncles, and cousins; her daughters father; his mother; and any number of so-called friends. Now she is ready to open a Pandoras box and share secrets about herself and others that everyone believed would go with them to their graves. She tells her story with the hope that when shes done, everything will finally be out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her memoir, she recalls the forty-year grieving process that she has undergone in order to get where she is today. She has overcome the sense of being held hostage by those whom she believed loved her. Exploring the tragic circumstances of her life, she discusses all the pain she experienced and affirms that God has given her the strength to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maya shares the honest saga of her trials and tribulations as she tried to navigate the world on the streets of Chicago. Now, after decades of grief and healing within the comforting arms of God, Maya is ready to finally say goodbye to her pain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
