  <title>A Rifleman&#39;s Diary - Eric Fawbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; In 1940, the author was accepted for RAF flying crew, then changed his mind and opted for the infantry (Why? - see book).  As he survived 6 years (4 in the front-lines of N.Africa, Italy and NW Europe) &#39;without a scratch&#39;, he has never regretted the change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in Civvy Street after the war, and having voted Churchill out of office, his diaries were relegated to the attic, and brought out only recently as of interest in his old age, and a change from the boredom of TV etc.  They did more than relieve boredom however, as they reminded him that his service, although not overtly recognised, was something to be proud of.  He decided that an &#39;easy reading&#39; book would be of interest to his two children and the family name, as well as an opportunity to dispel a number of fallacies of that time, and to give a true insight into the life and thoughts of a ranker &#39;in the field&#39;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The author believes that most war-books are biased to some extent, occasionally unintended, but often intentionally, so he stresses that this book adheres to the diary entries, written on site at the time, occasionally whilst still &#39;under fire&#39;. His views tend to be confrontational, but have not been challenged in the course of a private issue. This book is intended for a wider readership.
