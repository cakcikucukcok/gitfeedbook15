  <title>See Hear Yoko - Bob Gruen, Jody Denberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Conceived expressly for Yoko Ono as a gift between friends on the occasion of her eightieth birthday, &lt;em&gt;See Hear Yoko&lt;/em&gt; is a visual portrait of an icon of contemporary American cultural history, from her days with John Lennon through to the present. Legendary rock and roll photographer Bob Gruen was welcomed into the lives of John Lennon and Yoko Ono during their years in New York City, when Gruen served as their personal lensman, and he continues to document Yoko today. Approached by his friend Jody Denberg, an Austin rock radio mainstay who had logged twenty-five years of interviews with Yoko, Gruen collaborated with him to create an extraordinary birthday gift. In this breathtaking volume, Gruen has selected more than three hundred classic color and black-and-white photographs&amp;#8212;accompanied by text of Yoko&amp;#39;s insights gleaned from Denberg&amp;#39;s many hours of interviews&amp;#8212;to illuminate the intimate story of Yoko Ono at the height of her fame as a woman, wife, mother, and avant-garde artist who keeps creating because, as she notes, &amp;#34;that&amp;#39;s who I am.&amp;#34; Yoko&amp;#39;s role as a peace activist and artist underscores the enduring legacy of the era. &lt;em&gt;See Hear Yoko&lt;/em&gt; reveals a modern woman in love, in ascension, in grief, in joy, and in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavish and beautiful, mirroring the deeply personal design of the original volume given to Yoko herself, &lt;em&gt;See Hear Yoko&lt;/em&gt; brings into focus an extraordinary woman, and one of the most memorable periods in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
