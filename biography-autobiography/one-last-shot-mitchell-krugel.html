  <title>One Last Shot - Mitchell Krugel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Last Shot&lt;/i&gt; gives Jordan fans the inside scoop they&#39;re looking for on basketball&#39;s greatest legend, with exclusive interviews from NBA executives, players, and coaches. Mitchell Krugel uses his fifteen years of following Michael Jordan&#39;s every move to explain why the man who left the game as The Greatest Player of All Time would risk his unparalleled legend to play again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After delivering the Chicago Bulls their sixth championship in 1998 by pulling off what became known as the greatest money shot in the history of the NBA, Michael believed he still had much of that Greatest-Player-Of-All-Time left in his game. But he felt that retirement was forced on him in 1999, and he left the game craving more doses of fifty-point binges, winner-take-all confrontations, and repeated nights of reminding fans they just saw the greatest player ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Last Shot&lt;/i&gt; not only explains why Michael Jordan came back to the court but also looks at his transition from Wizards executive to player, his struggle to join a team that had grown up with his posters on their walls, and his glories and setbacks in a Wizards season chock full of both struggles and surprises. Krugel also details the star-laden workouts Michael designed in the summer of 2001 to get his game back into shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This look at Michael Jordan, circa 2001-2002, shows how much basketball had changed since his last coming and how much it hadn&#39;t, and how his drive pushed him to the verge of a crippling knee injury all in the pursuit of winning. And for six weeks he did make it back. He made the shots. He made good on his mission to teach the Wizards how to be winners, to teach talented teammate Richard Hamilton to be a shooting star, and to whip Kwame Brown, the high school kid he made the first-ever first pick in the NBA draft, into a man. And he did the things that only a man of legend could do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krugel analyzes both the man and the legend to trace how the First Coming led to a Second and to a Third, and he chronicles the season that defines Michael Jordan as a man who will forever be playing for one last shot.&lt;/p&gt;" />
