  <title>Mister B. : Living With a 98-Year-Old Rocket Scientist - A. Lynn Byk, Susan Lockwood Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this 2016 Pinnacle Award Winner, Joseph Byk the child on Polish immigrants begins his early schooling in rope-tied-baggy-pants-poverty. He is every teacher&amp;#39;s dreaded student. Ending his senior year at Woonsocket High, he begs a high school counselor to help him make up deficiencies in his math education. Why? Because, suddenly, he aspires to design vehicles that defy gravity. Mister B eventually helps design the space shuttle Gemini, the first moon landing gear, and the beginnings of Google Earth. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;This is a book - and a man - you won&amp;#39;t forget. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. B is quite the character! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I often found myself laughing out loud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and I received a basic education in rocket science as well! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lynn Byk&amp;#39;s interactions with his stories are genuine and insightful. I was enthralled right to the end. &lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; - Librarian Sue Lockwood Summers, also the author-teacher of&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Them Thinking! Use Media Literacy to Prepare Students for State Assessments. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Graduating from the University of Alabama, Mister B&amp;rsquo;s career begins on the back of a good ol&amp;rsquo; boy&amp;rsquo;s business card, with a reference to work for Vultee, in Downey, California. There, he helps design basic trainer war planes. When, at the beginning of WWII, he transfers to the Glen Martin Company in Baltimore, Maryland, he continues to perform stress analysis on spacecraft throughout the cold war.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Joseph Byk received his Ph.D. in aerospace engineering from the University of Alabama. He taught pilots in the air corps with Spartan Company and then worked through WWII and the cold war with Martin Company performing projects for NASA and the Department of Defense.&amp;nbsp; With a shot of respect, Mister B&amp;#39;s bygone family ideals confront the independence of a younger generation as he reveals a lifetime of secrets. Mister B&amp;#39;s family gains more than a conversationalist. They gain a friend.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For curiosity seekers of the aerospace industry wondering, &lt;em&gt;how did it all start?&lt;/em&gt; For students of math and science, for story lovers of the Greatest Generation and World War II, and for family members caring for aging parents... Mister B brings to you a genuine Americana storyline.&amp;nbsp; You can now find Mister B in the Grumpy Old Men section of the library.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Armchair philosophers, book clubs, and would-be scientists will appreciate Mister B&amp;rsquo;s wry interactions with his in-laws who move into his home to help him after the death&amp;nbsp;of his wife. The ol&amp;rsquo; man decides to teach these younger caretakers a thing or two: specifically that, his newest design&amp;nbsp;is to live forever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reader is carried from tragedy to hilarity as his companions seek to please him with foodie experiments while coaxing Mister B to upgrade his 44-year-old home. Too bad the only non-controversial place to renovate the HUD-styled real estate is in the weedy backyard. If only the younger couple had not promised to save their 97-year-old Polish father from the nursing home! A triangle forms as they study, and, tentatively approach one another. The ol&amp;rsquo; man and his new companions&amp;nbsp; gradually redesign a dry acre into a flowering conversation piece where mushroom collecting and the sources of hydrogen and iron are discussed.&amp;nbsp; Interior design must take a back seat while the scientific engineer challenges them to consider theories of deflection, accuracy, stress variables, and material strengths. With all the delicacy of designing a conical intersection onto a space capsule, the threesome focuses on integrating their relationships in 3-D.&lt;/p&gt;" />
