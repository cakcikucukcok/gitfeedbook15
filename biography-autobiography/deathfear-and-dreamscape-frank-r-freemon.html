  <title>Deathfear and Dreamscape - Frank R. Freemon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The narrator of this book, although blind, deaf, and paralyzed, interacts with a strange set of fictional characters who move about the fictional city of Nashville, Tennessee. A car salesman loves the smell of napalm in the morning. A sergeant pushes everyone out of his flying machine. A doctor finds two people living in the same body. A teacher forces a student to undergo an eyeball transplantation. A theologian claims that Jesus loves lesbians best of all. A cheerleader has a melon where her head should be. A pedophile exorcizes a demon. A minister fights evil by stabbing sinners to death. One man fathers a thousand children but his family does not show up for Sunday dinner. Real people mix with the fictional characters. Bob Hope holds the narrator&#39;s hand. James Earle Ray spends the night with a minister. Dinah Shore blows kisses and Jack Palance guns down a farmer. Kronos and his brothers move to Nashville to play football. Lamar Alexander digs up a coffin, pries open the lid, and shouts, &quot;It&#39;s alive.&quot; Romance softens the gore. One character rejects Prince Charming while her brother falls deeply in love with a woman who does not exist. Two lovebirds pitch woo by drilling holes in each other&#39;s skulls. A grand denouement weaves all these storylines together in a beautiful tapestry, but the reader must avoid the splatter of bright red blood. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best book written in English since Dante&#39;s Towering Inferno. &lt;br&gt;
Professor, School of Letters, University of the South &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is so complicated that it makes Tolstoy&#39;s War and Peace read like a Marvel comic book. &lt;br&gt;
