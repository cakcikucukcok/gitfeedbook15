  <title>Her Name Was Jane - Charles E Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t a famous person or even an infamous person. She wasn&amp;#39;t a historic figure that poets write odes about. She wasn&amp;#39;t a celebrity. She wasn&amp;#39;t a politician and she never did anything to save the world. She was not the person that producers would be standing in line to make a movie about her life. What she was, for 36 years, up until November 9, 2016, was my wife, the mother of our children, a Grandmother, my confidant, my lover, my best friend and one of the most incredible women I have ever known. Sometime during the night of November 9, 2016, Jane&amp;#39;s nine-year battle with breast cancer came to end and with it came the end of a long road that we had traveled together. A road that neither one of us ever expected to be on nor did we want to be on. But a road that we traveled together, no matter what the situation. A journey that I would not have wished on my worst enemy, but a road that I was glad to have been able to travel with her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
