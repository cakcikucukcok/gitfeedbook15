  <title>Me Life Story - Scarlett Moffatt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One girl&#39;s meteoric rise from sofa to TV stardom!
From beloved Gogglebox breakout star, to winner of I&#39;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, achieving her dream of presenting with Ant and Dec on Saturday Night Takeaway and filling Davina&#39;s shoes in the new series of Streetmate, Scarlett is quickly fast-tracking to national treasure status.
In what will quite surely be the funniest book of the year, laugh along with Scarlett as she describes her journey from ballroom dancing diva, to adventures with her survivalist Dad, working at ASDA and life as a student. But along with the highs there have been tough times, including bullying during her teenage years. With her typical tenacity and trademark wit, Scarlett pulls through it all.
This is our favourite Northerner as we have never heard her before, telling it like it is on EVERYTHING she&#39;s experienced so far. Warm, funny and honest, this is the amazing story that resulted in Scarlett becoming our favourite TV star: sofa, so good!" />
