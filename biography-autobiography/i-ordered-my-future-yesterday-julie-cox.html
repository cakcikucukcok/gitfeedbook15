  <title>I Ordered My Future Yesterday - Julie Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Julie Cox is no ordinary woman. Born in the Philippines, shes carved out an 
amazingly fruitful life after overcoming a plethora of obstacles which would 
have broken a lesser person. In her new book, I Ordered my Future Yesterday, 
Julie recounts the trials and tribulations shes faced, from being raped twice 
and left for dead, living in extreme poverty, experiencing the death of various 
loved ones, and giving up for adoption the baby she had after being raped 
a second time.
Julie recounts the ups and downs of her life from living for two years scavenging 
as a semi-orphan amid a garbage dump at the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay to 
moving from the Philippines to the United States. Upon arriving in the U.S., she 
began a series of odd jobs which eventually led her to a successful sales career 
at a Fortune 500 company. During this time, she was also busy building her dream 
resort and academic training center in the Philippine islands one step at a time. 
And now, through sheer hard work and crafty planning, shes halfway toward her 
goal of becoming a millionaire.
Even if youre broken, negative, bitter, depressed, outmanned, and outgunned, nothing 
can stop you from finding your destiny!&quot;" />
