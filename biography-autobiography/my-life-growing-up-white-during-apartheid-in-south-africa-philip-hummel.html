  <title>My Life Growing up White During Apartheid in South Africa - Philip Hummel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; This book is a short collection of memories about being white and living in South Africa during Apartheid.  I wrote this book for the reader to easily understand what it was like to live in this environment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is not a history lesson, but some personal experiences that I went through living in South Africa at the time.  Living through apartheid I never even realized that it even existed, because we were brought up to believe that it was normal.   Life was paradise for me and hell for others!  Many of us did not know or care, and even if we did try to change the system, it would have resulted in prison or death. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We believed that changing apartheid would have caused the country to fall into the hands of the communists, and many white people were fearful that black rule would have destroyed South Africa and their lives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The other side of the coin is that I cant comprehend what the lives of most blacks was like, which was excruciatingly difficult, something that I didnt personally experience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our history books never taught us anything good about blacks.  I cant remember ever learning anything positive that blacks did. What I did learn was that they were lazy, uneducated, dangerous, and drank a lot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Stay away from them, and if they bother you call the police. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There were serious injustices in South Africa, and many black people suffered under the Apartheid Regime. &lt;/p&gt;" />
