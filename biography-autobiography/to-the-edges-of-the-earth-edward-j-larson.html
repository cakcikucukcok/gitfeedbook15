Before the calendar turned, three expeditions had faced death, mutiny, and the harshest conditions on the planet to plant flags at the furthest edges of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of one extraordinary year, Americans Robert Peary and Matthew Henson were hailed worldwide at the discovers of the North Pole; Britain&amp;#8217;s Ernest Shackleton had set a new geographic &amp;#8220;Furthest South&amp;#8221; record, while his expedition mate, Australian Douglas Mawson, had reached the Magnetic South Pole; and at the roof of the world, Italy&amp;#8217;s Duke of the Abruzzi had attained an altitude record that would stand for a generation, the result of the first major mountaineering expedition to the&amp;#160;Himalaya&#39;s eastern Karakoram, where the daring aristocrat attempted K2 and established the standard route up the most notorious mountain on the planet.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on extensive archival and on-the-ground research, Edward J. Larson weaves these narratives into one thrilling adventure story&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Larson, author of the acclaimed polar history &lt;em&gt;Empire of Ice&lt;/em&gt;, draws on his own voyages to the Himalaya, the arctic, and the ice sheets of the Antarctic, where he himself reached the South Pole and lived in Shackleton&amp;#8217;s Cape Royds hut as a fellow in the National Science Foundations&amp;#8217; Antarctic Artists and Writers Program.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three legendary expeditions, overlapping in time, danger, and stakes, were glorified upon their return, their leaders celebrated as the preeminent heroes of their day. Stripping away the myth, Larson, a master historian, illuminates one of the great, overlooked tales of exploration, revealing the extraordinary human achievement at the heart of these journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
