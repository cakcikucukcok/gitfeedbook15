&lt;p&gt;I Love It!!! I Absolutely Love It!!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertaining.... A Surprise in Every Section!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Klein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should read this book!  Its Rare!  Its Real!  Its Rich with real-life experiences from a great story teller. Ive known Gerry for 30+ years, and I can also ....Swear it is True! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike West&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Who knew expert businessman and entrepreneur, Gerry Shaltz could demand, claim and capture our attention with such unabashed, electrifying and candid work of literature!?  These pages reveal some delightful and unexpected secrets about Gerrys life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether in Africa, Hollywood or Baker, California, these remarkable episodes of Gerrys fascinating experiences Lure  from brawls and bullies, to prom night and Paul Newman. They Teach  from wealth and ruin, to gambling addiction and victorious recovery.  They Enlighten  As elephants model the importance of community and team-work.  They Encourage  As a defiant young warthog fights to live, despite defeat.  Whether cleverly intentional or genius overflow, Gerry clearly coaches us in the arts of Loving, Learning, Growing, Thriving, Forgiving, Accepting and Releasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From its explosive start, to the heart-wrenching final pages, some may wonder in awe, Is it REALLY TRUE?  But all who dare take this ride will cherish a seat on his courageous, insightful and passionate journey of self-exploration.  Still others will simply surrender and ask, Where to next, Gerry?&lt;/p&gt;" />
