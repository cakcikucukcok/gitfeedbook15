  <title>On Henry Miller - John Burnside</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The American writer Henry Miller&#39;s critical reputation--if not his popular readership&amp;#8212;has been in eclipse at least since Kate Millet&#39;s blistering critique in &lt;i&gt;Sexual Politics&lt;/i&gt;, her landmark 1970 study of misogyny in literature and art. Even a Miller fan like the acclaimed Scottish writer John Burnside finds Miller&#39;s &quot;sex books&quot;&amp;#8212;including &lt;i&gt;The Rosy Crucifixion&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Tropic of Cancer&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Tropic of Capricorn&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8212;&quot;boring and embarrassing.&quot; But Burnside says that Miller&#39;s notorious image as a &quot;pornographer and woman hater&quot; has hidden his vital, true importance&amp;#8212;his anarchist sensibility and the way it shows us how, by fleeing from conformity of all kinds, we may be able to save ourselves from the &quot;air-conditioned nightmare&quot; of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller wrote that &quot;there is no salvation in becoming adapted to a world which is crazy,&quot; and in this short, engaging, and personal book, Burnside shows how Miller teaches us to become less adapted to the world, to resist a life sentence to the prison of social, intellectual, emotional, and material conditioning. Exploring the full range of Miller&#39;s work, and giving special attention to &lt;i&gt;The Air-Conditioned Nightmare&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Colossus of Maroussi&lt;/i&gt;, Burnside shows how, with humor and wisdom, Miller illuminates the misunderstood tradition of anarchist thought. Along the way, Burnside reflects on Rimbaud&#39;s enormous influence on Miller, as well as on how Rimbaud and Miller have influenced his own writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unconventional and appealing account of an unjustly neglected writer, &lt;i&gt;On Henry Miller&lt;/i&gt; restores to us a figure whose searing criticism of the modern world has never been more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;" />
