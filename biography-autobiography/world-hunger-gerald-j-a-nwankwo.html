  <title>World Hunger - Gerald J. A. Nwankwo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="World Hunger is one mans hunger which precipitates a world hunger.  The hunger for freedom in World Hunger, though individual and isolated, is universal.  It is a hunger to go to The United States, understand its peoples and culture, and to eventually become one among the Free and the Proud.  It is a dormant dream which is ignited by the Nigerian Military oppression and marginalization of the humanity of the Igbo tribe after the Civil War, commonly known as the Biafran War.  It was a dream that nothing but the Statue of Liberty could satisfy.  Once aflame, that dream became an excruciating hunger.  Neither the laws of London and the British Customs officers nor the New York Immigration officers could stop the roaring flame in the author; he was bent on meeting face to face with the renowned Statue of Liberty.  Reading World Hunger is like reading a Catechism of Social Questions; it places God at the center of every endeavor and every hardship, including but not limited to His readiness to follow His own creation as a guide in prison; it is a recreation of Gods eminent presence in His creation." />
