  <title>Ang Lee - Karla Rae Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese born, Ang Lee (b. 1954) has produced diverse films in his award-winning body of work. Sometimes working in the West, sometimes in the East, he creates films that defy easy categorization and continue to amaze audiences worldwide. Lee has won an Academy Award two times for Best Director&amp;#8212;the first Asian to win&amp;#8212;for films as different as a small drama about gay cowboys in &lt;i&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/i&gt; (2005), and the 3D technical wizardry in &lt;i&gt;Life of Pi&lt;/i&gt; (2012). He has garnered numerous accolades and awards worldwide.&lt;p&gt;Lee has made a broad range of movies, including his so-called &amp;#8220;Father Knows Best&amp;#8221; trilogy made up of his first three films: &lt;i&gt;Pushing Hands&lt;/i&gt; (1992), &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Banquet&lt;/i&gt; (1993), and &lt;i&gt;Eat Drink Man Woman&lt;/i&gt; (1994), as well as 1970s period drama &lt;i&gt;The Ice Storm&lt;/i&gt; (1997), martial arts film &lt;i&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;/i&gt; (2000), superhero blockbuster &lt;i&gt;Hulk&lt;/i&gt; (2003), and hippie retro trip &lt;i&gt;Taking Woodstock&lt;/i&gt; (2009).&lt;p&gt;Thoughtful and passionate, Ang Lee humbly reveals here a personal journey that brought him from Taiwan to his chosen home in the United States as he struggled and ultimately triumphed in his quest to become a superb filmmaker. &lt;i&gt;Ang Lee: Interviews&lt;/i&gt; collects the best interviews of this reticent yet bold figure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
