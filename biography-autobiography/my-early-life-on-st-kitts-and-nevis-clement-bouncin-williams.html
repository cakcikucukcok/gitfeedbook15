I loved it all! Especially the portion about the entrepreneurial prowess of the authors mother!!!! AMAZING!!!Being first generation Kitty-Nevy I don&#39;t have the privilege of the oratory exchange between one generation and another about life on St. Kitts and Nevis in years gone by.  This book provides me with that oratory exchange; ranging from food and beverage preparations to reasons for the creation of communities which I pass  often on my current day&#39;s journey to  aspects of our Health, Education, Economic and Political systems. Thus presenting great evidence of the tremendous strides our Federation has made over the decades.  Whether from the Federation or the wider Caribbean this book will cause some to reminisce, others to be educated and for all to take pride in the wisdom of our people!  Unoma Allen, M.Sc. Lecturer CFB College, St. Kitts." />
