  <title>The Shadow of the Rainbow - C.V. Schweitzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall with my wife in 1991 and being a student of history, I continue my interest online.
   I was surprised to find that among the fifty-eight-thousand-plus Vietnam veterans memorialized on that cold black granite wall in Washington, D.C., somehow twelve names of people who were still alive were among them. 
  One day shortly after I retired, my wife, Ann, like many wives do, became annoyed at my being under her feet all day and suggested quite emphatically that I go find a hobby.  
  So I did, hence, The Shadow of the Rainbow.  
  Based loosely on historical facts, this is a fictitious story of a thirteenth persons name on the wall that woke up from coma one day to find he still had a chance to follow those dreams that had been so violently snatched from all the others." />
