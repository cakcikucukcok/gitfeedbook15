  <title>Dangerous When Wet - Jamie Brickhouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A blisteringly funny, wrenching account of wrestling way too close to--and later loose from--booze, sex and drugs and his adorable, infuriating mother. Bravo!&quot; --Mary Karr, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Liars&#39; Club&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Whoever said you can&#39;t get sober for someone else never met my mother, Mama Jean. When I came to in a Manhattan emergency room after an overdose to the news that she was on her way from Texas, I panicked. She was the last person I wanted to see on that dark September morning, but the person I needed the most.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins this astonishing memoir--by turns both darkly comic and deeply poignant--about this native Texan&#39;s long struggle with alcohol, his complicated relationship with Mama Jean, and his sexuality. From the age of five all Brickhouse wanted was to be at a party with a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other and all Mama Jean wanted was to keep him at that age, her Jamie doll forever. A Texan Elizabeth Taylor with the split personality of Auntie Mame and Mama Rose, always camera-ready and flamboyantly outspoken, Mama Jean haunted him his whole life, no matter how far away he went or how deep in booze he swam.&lt;br&gt;Brickhouse&#39;s journey takes him from Texas to a high-profile career in book publishing amid New York&#39;s glamorous drinking life to his near-fatal descent into alcoholism. After Mama Jean ushers him into rehab and he ultimately begins to dig out of the hole he&#39;d found himself in, he almost misses his chance to prove that he loves her as much as she loves him. Bitingly funny, raw, and insightful, &lt;i&gt;Dangerous When Wet&lt;/i&gt; is the unforgettable story of a unique relationship between a son and his mother.&lt;/p&gt;" />
