  <title>Churchill: Pictorial History of his Life &amp; Times - Ian S. Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Sir Winston Churchill, voted the greatest Briton of all time, died 50 years ago on January 24th 1965. Born on November 30th 1874, he entered Parliament in 1900 and dominated political life for over half a century until his retirement in 1955. His leadership of the British people in the Second World War (when he was Prime Minister from 1940 to 1945) was in inspiration to them and the free world and remains a period of defining historical importance. His career would have been a significant one even had he not become Prime Minister in 1940&amp;#160;(as he also won the Nobel Prize for Literature)&amp;#160;and he went on to play a major political role for another ten years after 1945 serving again as the country&#39;s premier from 1951 to 1955.  Noted Churchill historian Ian S. Wood assesses his character and achievements in this 50th anniversary edition which offers a remarkable visual record of Churchill&#39;s life and times&lt;/div&gt;" />
