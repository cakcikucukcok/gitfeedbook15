  <title>Faith to Dream Big - Javier René Solís</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a fiction flash and dash story line and sassy phrasing, this is definitely not the book for you.  This is a real story of the American dream come true.  It is about a Hispanic man, Ramon Villarreal Sr., his faith, dreams, family, suffering, and perseverance.  These ultimately lead him from obscurity and poverty to prominence and prosperity.  He is able to maintain his humility from having &quot;no say&quot; to remarkably having the &quot;final say&quot;.  This is a recipe and study of good old-fashioned values, diligent hard work, and faith in God.  In, perhaps, the most unlikely of settings in deep south Texas along the Mexican border, you will find the main principles that can make any person anywhere a  true success.  Read and use it for family entertainment or as a personal manual / teaching tool, as it  focuses on spiritual, practical, business, cultural, historical, and inspirational themes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
