  <title>Only the Good Die Young - John B. Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a man who was born and grew up in NOVA SCOTIA. HE slipped out of high school when he was seventeen and a half years of age and joined the RCAF. After starting training to be a pilot, he transferred to gunnery school and eventually became a flight sergeant air gunner.
	After two and a half years, and the end of the war, he was discharged and worked in various parts of eastern Canada.
	He travelled and played in several areas of the world including such places as South America, Central America, Europe, Australia, and parts of East Asia.
	This book is the story of hismyadventures. It is intended to be a work of nonfiction but, because of a defective and sometimes selective memory, may also be viewed as fiction.
	Should this work ever reach print, I might, for a slight remuneration, be willing to include your name, remove your name, or provide a signed first edition.
	I should also advise that as I am a painter, I can supply a crappy 14 x 11 framed painting of a local scene for a minimal fee, painted with acrylic paint for only fifty dollars. This is a limited time offer.
	Dont worry that the fact that I am eighty-six years old might preclude me from concluding any or all transactions. Remember . . . ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG." />
