  <title>Against the Grain - Bill Sanders, Jules Feiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While political cartoonist Bill Sanders’s book may be a memoir, it is primarily a chronicle of his brushes with history during the era that stretched from the presidency of John Kennedy to that of Barack Obama—and of his good fortune to have had personal contact with some of the major actors on the political and social stage.
After briefly telling of his roots in Tennessee, Florida, and Kentucky and how he became a cartoonist, Sanders leads the reader on a guided tour—illustrated with photos and his cartoons—through the headlines of the last half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. 
Following World War Two, the “between” generation entered the young adult world of the early 1950s. It was a time of panty raids, Levittown, Dixieland jazz, early rock and roll, and television’s coming of age. It was a time when “war” morphed into “conflicts” and Korea took some from this transitional generation to their graves, calling into question the United States’ role as a global power.
As the era unfolded, the cold war and civil rights challenged Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Meanwhile, extremism found regional traction in the John Birch Society, the Minute Men, the bombast of Southern demagogues, and Barry Goldwater’s campaign. LBJ redeemed the national pledge on civil rights but was diverted into the swamp of Vietnam’s civil war where his political career perished. Richard Nixon then rose like Lazarus and eventually truncated the Vietnam War, but his personal demons led to the corruption of Watergate.
Bookended by the Jimmy Carter and George Bush I interludes, the carefully constructed myth of Ronald Reagan closed the door to progressive taxation, caged the regulatory watchdogs, and flowed massive wealth to the 1%. Stained by Monicagate and hindered by the Blue Dogs, Bill Clinton did not reverse this course. Then came the age of preemptive war and torture after the Supreme Court elected George Bush II by a 5–4 vote. Dubya and his fellow neocon draft dodgers—aided by a new age of partisan TV pundits and internet bloggers and an arthritic print media—lied and deceived the American public into an unjustified war of aggression. On the other hand, a new era began with the election of Barack Obama, the hijacking of the Republican Party by a coalition of rich white men and Tea Party fanatics, and the Supreme Court’s awarding of “personhood.”
All in all, the era has been a cartoonist’s feast." />
