  <title>Nellie and Charlie - Helen Tower Brunet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Nellie Smith from Oakland, California met Charlie Tower, a young millionaire from Philadelphia on a cruise to Alaska in l887, it was love at first sight. They soon married and moved to Philadelphia&#39;s Rittenhouse Square.&lt;/p&gt;
In 1897, President McKinley appointed Charlie, now called Charlemagne, Minister to Austria-Hungary. The Towers moved with their five small children to a palace in Vienna where Mark Twain became a regular visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
Charlemagne was named Ambassador to Russia in 1899. He and Nellie witnessed the sumptuous grandeur of the Court of Tsar Nicholas II in St. Petersburg. Upon the Towers&#39; departure from Russia in 1902, they were accorded the singular honor of visiting the royal family at their vacation home in the Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;
During Charlemagne&#39;s six years as American Ambassador to Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II considered him a friend and thought Nellie the most brilliant hostess on the international scene.&lt;/p&gt;
Returning home to Philadelphia, family scandal and personal tragedy awaited as Nellie and Charlemagne saw the Europe they had known destroyed by war.&lt;/p&gt;
Through diaries, letters and contemporary accounts, &lt;I&gt;Nellie and Charlie&lt;/I&gt; gives a personal history of an American family living on two continents at the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
