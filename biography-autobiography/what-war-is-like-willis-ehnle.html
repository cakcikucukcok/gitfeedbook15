  <title>What War Is Like - Willis Ehnle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a one year journal written by a soldier who was drafted into the U.S. Army as a conscientious objector. In July of 1950 the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea. The U.S. declared war on North Korea and the author of this book was called into active duty from the reserves, given brief training and rushed overseas. 
It was the purpose of the author to keep record of what was being experienced and spoken by the troops, so that others could know what it is like to be sent overseas in time of war. Troops were given their assignments in Japan. 
The author wrote a daily journal and sent it to his sister, Caroline, every week, who typed it. The author did not read his journal until 2008 when he and his wife, Lois, returned to the States from Japan. He then decided to make it available to the general public. 
The book contains much information about the Korean War, as told to the author by the troops who came into the Tokyo Army Hospital where he was stationed. 
The authors teenage granddaughter said it should be in every Christian bookstore." />
