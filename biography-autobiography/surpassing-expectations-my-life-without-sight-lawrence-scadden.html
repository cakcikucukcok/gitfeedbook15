  <title>Surpassing Expectations: My Life Without Sight - Lawrence Scadden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In high school, despite my passion for and acumen in math and science, I was counseled to avoid higher education in these fields because there would not be employment opportunities for a blind man in these disciplines.  Surpassing Expectations: My Life without Sight is a memoir which describes the activities that brought me international acclaim as a scientist, policymaker, and advocate.  Dozens of vignettes are included that portray my joyous and successful life despite having been blind since the age of five.  
	The book was written to be informative, entertaining, and, hopefully for some, inspirational.  Many people have a disability or at least a functional limitation, and too many of them feel lost, not knowing whether life will ever be fulfilling for them.  Often they are helped by learning about someone else with a disability who had the motivation, persistence, and tools that allowed him or her to overcome their difficulties and to attain a higher quality of life.  My book is intended to serve this purpose.
	Dispersed throughout the autobiographical material, I answer questions that people regularly pose to me:  
What emotional crises did I face when adapting to blindness as a child?  
What barriers did I encounter during my education and when seeking competitive employment?  What techniques do I use to ensure safe independent travel especially in foreign countries?  
What adaptations did I need to make as a husband and father?  
What type of technological tools do I use to reduce the effects of blindness?  
What imagery do blind people experience in their thoughts and dreams?  
	The memoir describes legislation that I drafted, which enhanced computer usability for people with disabilities.  I also recount incidents that occurred during my numerous foreign travels, invitations to speak and advise in venues such as the White House and Universal Television studios, and my interactions with famous people from Swedish Queen Silvia to Geraldo Rivera.  The book concludes with my thoughts on how I succeeded in my education and arduous career while enjoying an active life.  I offer suggestions on how my formula for success and happiness can be emulated by others, especially young people who also have a disability." />
