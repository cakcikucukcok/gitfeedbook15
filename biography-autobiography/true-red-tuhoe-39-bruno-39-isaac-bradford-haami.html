  <title>True Red - Tuhoe &#39;Bruno&#39; Isaac, Bradford Haami</title>

Its ferocious habits were engraved on our hearts,&amp;rdquo; Tuhoe says, &amp;ldquo;If you weren&amp;rsquo;t a mobster you weren&amp;rsquo;t worth knowing.&amp;rdquo; He lived this way for &amp;nbsp;17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, constantly living for the bash, beer, prison and the possibility of dying in a pool of blood eventually saw Tuhoe search for another way of doing life. Leaving the Mob was hard. Not only did he face the rejection of his own and the ?erce judgemental prejudices of mainstream society, but with the awakening of his conscience came the realisation of a past ?lled with in?icting pain on others besides himself, and of a life devoid of any sense of love or hope. This led him down a path of confession, forgiveness and reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True Red is the essential biography of one man&amp;#39;s fascinating&amp;nbsp;journey from the realm of darkness into the world of light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
