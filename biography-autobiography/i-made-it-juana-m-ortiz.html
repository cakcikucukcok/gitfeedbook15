  <title>I Made It! - Juana M. Ortiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Juana Ortiz was born with cerebral palsy in the Dominican Republic, a country where prejudice against people with disabilities is strong. 
In I Made It, Ortiz shares the story of her experiences and struggles throughout her life, particularly her difficulties within the educational system. Through her writing, she seeks to address common misunderstandings that persist with regard to people with disabilities and their enrollment in school and to raise awareness regarding the inclusion of students with disabilities in mainstream classes throughout college. A tale of achieving goals that seemed unreachable, her personal narrative offers hope and inspiration to those looking to live their dreams.
While this book is both empowering and inspirational, it isnt about cerebral palsy. I Made It is meant to challenge the societal and cultural expectations that are placed on those living with disabilities. Through determination and an unyielding desire to live her life, the author offers a heartfelt glimpse into her life and how she overcame those barriers.

I Made It is  an eloquent and honest account of overcoming cultural and disability related barriers  As the author writes, following your butterflies. Full of heart and wisdom, it is a glimpse into the beauty of the human spirit and one womans determination to live her dreams.
