  <title>Who Do You Think You Are? - André Olivier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever stopped to wonder why you were born to the parents you had? Why you are in the country you swear allegiance too. How tradition, culture, values, and life itself impact on you. What about sickness, suffering and deathdeath of children, not just one or two children in your own family, but the entire family but not you? When is it your turn to die as a child? Who is responsible for these deaths? 
What happens when you get to a point in your life one day when you must answer the question Who do you think you are? Does the answer to this question change at certain time lines in your life or does the answer remain the same? 
What impact does special force training, combat even protection of the state president of a country have on your response to these questions? What happens one day when you have an encounter with the living Godthe God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? This book is an honest answer to these and many more questions that the author found during his journey in writing this book." />
