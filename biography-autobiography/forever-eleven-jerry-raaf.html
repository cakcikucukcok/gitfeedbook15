  <title>Forever Eleven - Jerry Raaf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Forever Eleven&#39; is an adventure filled comedy with inspiration and pathos. It is a poignant coming of age story woven with emotion. 
An eleven year toughened city boy matures into a wiser young lad during his summer vacation on a ranch with an aunt he knows little about. A wonderful friendship is formed with an enigmatic aunt, who is seasoned by a life painted in darker colors, an older yet romantic rancher and a wonderful dog named Fritz. This friendship provides a growth spurt in the lad&#39;s spirit and influences his future.
Everyday circumstances will have you laughing with abandonment over innocent exploits and then suddenly agonizing over personal tragedies. The lad experiences the sting of romance and narrow escapes from wild and domestic animals. Chapter titles such as: The Church Diving Board, The Outhouse Auction, The Hook in the Ear, Poor Footing in Centre Field are just a few of the personal adventures that changed his life.
This is truly an absorbing, heart-warming and thought provoking book that will not be easily forgotten.
