  <title>The Martian Child - David Gerrold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Novel about a Single Father Adopting a Son&lt;br&gt;Based on a True Story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Oh. One more thing: Dennis thinks he&#39;s a  Martian . . . .&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon-to-be parents are instructed to &quot;expect the unexpected.&quot; Good advice, it turns out. Especially for the anxious or apprehensive parent who is considering adoption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can one know about an adopted child?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All David Gerrold &lt;i&gt;knew &lt;/i&gt;for certain was that he wanted to be a parent. As a single gay man he thought adoption would be the most direct route to fatherhood. But he soon found out-to both his joy and dismay-that the emotional route to fatherhood was anything but direct. In fact, it was a roller-coaster ride that changed his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he first saw the picture of eight-year-old Dennis beaming up at him from the photograph in the adoption book, David &lt;i&gt;knew &lt;/i&gt;this was the boy for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these were the facts: Abandoned as an infant by drug-addicted parents. Documented abuse. Shuffled from one foster home to another. Deficit hyperactivity disorder. Ritalin to control his violent emotional outbursts. For his antisocial behavior: Disipramine. The conclusion from experts: Dennis was &quot;hard to place.&quot; A polite bureaucratic euphemism for unadoptable. It was a depressing assessment that David could not-&lt;i&gt;would no&lt;/i&gt;t-accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He needed Dennis. And he believed Dennis needed him. It was that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the reality of single fatherhood set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A searingly honest, funny, moving, and heartfelt portrait of the joys and perils of parenting, &lt;i&gt;The Martian Child&lt;/i&gt; is David Gerrold&#39;s valentine to the redemptive value of love,in this case a father&#39;s love for his son. A son who thinks he&#39;s a Martian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
