  <title>Settle for More - Megyn Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;#8217;s asking tough questions during a presidential debate or pressing for answers to today&amp;#8217;s most important issues, Megyn Kelly has demonstrated the intelligence, strength, common sense, and courage that have made her one of today&amp;#8217;s best-known journalists, respected by women and men, young and old, Republicans and Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Settle for More&lt;/em&gt;, the NBC News anchor reflects on the enduring values and experiences that have shaped her&amp;#8212;from growing up in a family that rejected the &quot;trophies for everyone&quot; mentality, to her father&amp;#8217;s sudden, tragic death while she was in high school. She goes behind-the-scenes of her career, sharing the stories and struggles that landed her in the anchor chair and taught her to ask the tough questions. Speaking candidly about her decision to &quot;settle for more&quot;&amp;#8212;a motto she credits as having dramatically transformed her life at home and at work&amp;#8212;Megyn discusses how she abandoned a thriving legal career to follow her journalism dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admired for her hard work, humor, and authenticity, Megyn sheds light on the news business, her time at Fox News, the challenges of being a professional woman and working mother, and her most talked about television moments. She also speaks openly about Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s feud with her, revealing never-before-heard details about the first Republican debate, its difficult aftermath, and how she persevered through it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeply personal and surprising, &lt;em&gt;Settle for More&lt;/em&gt; offers unparalleled insight into this charismatic and intriguing journalist, and inspires us all to embrace the principles&amp;#8212;determination, honesty, and fortitude in the face of fear&amp;#8212;that have won her fans across the political divide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
