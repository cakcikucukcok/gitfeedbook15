Described as emerging, charismatic, modern, reformed, refined, innovative and contemporary; this global church has promoted Christianity to be fashionable. Spearhead by internationally renowned televangelist preachers who teach and adopt a fundamental faith movement.&lt;p&gt;This radical journey of outspoken faith has become the fastest growing craze in modern Christianity and been undertaken by millions of unsuspecting people who are leaving their traditional mainstream churches to join this innovative solution for their faith. Their sermons have become the most listened to gospel in modern time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open the Church Doors and Let Me Out!&lt;/strong&gt; is the remarkable true story of a missionary family travelling to North America only to find themselves abandoned by this local church.
