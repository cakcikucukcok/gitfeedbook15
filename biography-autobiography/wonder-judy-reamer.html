  <title>Wonder - Judy Reamer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Experience the humor, heartbreak, and elation of this riveting narrative about Judy Reamer, whose curious mind took her into surprising places and uncharted waters. A book, a trip to Las Vegas, and a worldwide entertainer were all instrumental in moving this independent Jewish Philadelphian beyond her self-centered world. Wired to wonder, Judy ultimately found herself wired for wonders when her dramatically changing worldview led to repeated encounters with Gods supernatural work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Judys story will take you through her escape from the heavy hand of the cults and the strong arm of the turbulent USSR, an unjust courtroom outcome, and her husbands untimely death. But most remarkable of all, youll see what happened when this wondering Jew met the most famous man of all ages, born across the sea. Life was never the same. Nor was it boring. Oy!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wait till you read this story about my great friend Judy.  Her writing style is remarkably simple, but her story is simply remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat Boone, singer, actor, author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Judys story has much to teach, and because of my Jewish background, it resonated profoundly. I love her, and you will too.&lt;/p&gt;
