  <title>Please God, Don&#39;t Let My Badge Tarnish - Kevin LaChapelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When author Kevin LaChapelle begins his career as a police officer in El Cajon, California, he fulfills a lifelong dream. But the dream soon turns into a nightmare when he discovers corruption within the ranks of the El Cajon Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Please God, Don&#39;t Let My Badge Tarnish&lt;/I&gt; is the story of LaChapelle&#39;s struggle to work in the department after his shocking discovery. Rather than turn his back on the scandal and save his career, LaChapelle begins a courageous fight to bring the officers to justice. At the same time, he earns awards for his work in helping young people turn away from gangs and violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
In 1994, at the urging of his fellow citizens, LaChapelle runs for the local school board. Soon he is engaged in a new battle after he uncovers major financial problems in the district and discovers that greedy officials are siphoning money intended to fund school programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
In the wake of these two major battles, LaChapelle founds the Special Investigations Agency, which is dedicated to helping communities nationwide fight corruption in their local government officials and uncover scams against citizens, particularly the elderly and disadvantaged minorities. His fight for justice continues today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
