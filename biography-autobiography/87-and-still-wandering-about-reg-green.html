  <title>87 and Still Wandering About - Reg Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reg Green is a pitch-perfect writer and these highly-entertaining essays allow us to accompany him as he hikes along mountain trails, braves raging rapids and makes his way through a remarkably rewarding life. 
Robert Kiener, senior writer, Readers Digest 
For nearly 50 years, I have reveled in the friendship of Reg Green. He is adventurous, funny and mischievous -- sometimes all at once. Reg is irrepressible. A transplanted Fleet Street journalist, nowadays you can find him -- if you can keep up -- hiking alone in the San Gabriel Mountains, near his home in Southern California. He sets a mean pace for a man of 87. But there is something else you must know about Reg: he is lifesaver. When his seven-year-old son, Nicholas, was murdered in Italy in 1994, Reg and his wife, Maggie, donated seven of Nicholass organs so others might live. Since then they have traveled the world, promoting organ donation, and many are alive as a result. Part of this book is about the extraordinary people Reg and Maggie met on their mission. But there is more: there are essays, op-eds and photographs. This is a dufflebag of a book, full of wonderful things -- full, if you will, of the essential Reg Green, bon vivant, humanitarian and writer. 
Llewellyn King, executive producer and host, White House Chronicle on PBS, and Huffington Post columnist
Praise for Reg Greens previous books: 
I can think of no book that surpasses The Nicholas Effect [www.authorhouse.com] in opening the heart and changing attitudes for the common good throughout the world. 
Bud Gardner, editor, Chicken Soup for the Writers Soul
The Gift that Heals (www.authorhouse.com): No one has done more for public awareness in organ donation in the entire world. 
Howard Nathan, president and CEO, the Gift of Life Donor Program" />
