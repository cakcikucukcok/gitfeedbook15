  <title>An Accidental Memoir: How I Killed Someone and Other Stories - Wendy Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a rainy Tuesday morning in 1996, Wendy Reed&#39;s car hydroplaned, crossed an interstate median, and crashed into an oncoming car, whose driver was killed. Though Reed and her son were unharmed and Reed initially described herself as &quot;fine,&quot; in the months that followed she would be engulfed in a storm of guilt and recrimination, as well as jarring legal proceedings over the accident.In An Accidental Memoir, Reed, an award-winning documentary filmmaker, points the lens at herself and explores that accident and a succession of personal experiences through fact and fiction. Told from unusual perspectives and in highly figurative language, the stories draw on the Southern Gothic tradition of Flannery O&#39;Connor and feature dark humor, flawed people, disastrous events, and moments of spiritual grace. Taken together, this collection of deliberately fragmented essays and short stories become a meditation on subjects such as work, family responsibilities, death, and raising a child." />
