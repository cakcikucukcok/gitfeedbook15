  <title>Gloria – a Student’S Memoir of Intended Paths - Priscilla Jacobson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A speech professor and her student make a unique connection that changes each others lives. Mrs. Noble encourages Priscilla to engage in public speaking, yet discovers in her student that where spoken words faltered, writing flourished. Priscilla, driven to profess God in her speech, is unsure what her professor believes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mrs. Noble approves a persuasive speech about Ronald Reagans character and values, Priscilla begins an in-depth research project on the Cold War. The research reveals that Reagan was a former pacifist and Mikhail Gorbachev was a secret believer in God. This memoir contains analogies and metaphors that thread the research into the research experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Reykjavik Summit, an agreement could not be made because neither Reagan nor Gorbachev revealed their beliefs. Both leaders were misunderstood. A misunderstanding which must be clarified as the research is prepared for the symposium presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A serendipitous path leads Priscilla to interview Mrs. Noble, only to discover her professors intended path was not the path on which she ended up. Priscilla writes about unexpected detours. Then Mrs. Noble reveals a paper she formerly wrote, quoting A Road Less Traveled By. This intuitive student later analyzes the two papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will Priscilla present Ronald Reagan in the Undergraduate Research Symposium, when she soon discovers her professor is battling cancer? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gloria  A Students Memoir of Intended Paths is a message of hope and faith. In it Priscilla looks up to God and Mrs. Noble during a brief crossroads and an unforgettable experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
