  <title>Your Vote Is Magic! - Lyn Inc. Dillies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="America&amp;#39;s premier female Illusionist, Lyn Dillies, adds another DIMENSION to her sparkling career:  YOUR VOTE IS MAGIC!, the book based on  the groundbreaking illusion she conjured up to deliver a powerful message to get out the vote.   At a rally in New Bedford, Massachusetts before the 2008 Presidential election, Lyn produced a live elephant and a live donkey, (the two party mascots) &amp;quot;out of thin air!&amp;quot;  The illusion impressively delivered the non-partisan message that YOUR VOTE IS MAGIC! and prompted a large voter registration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the book that TELLS ALL (Almost) . . . Lyn REVEALS just how important your vote really is!   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a personal basis, Lyn describes HOW and WHY she created the illusion, overcoming seemingly daunting obstacles.&lt;br&gt;Challenges are nothing new to Lyn.  She is well known for imaginative, unique programs and illlusions. The book, YOUR VOTE IS MAGIC! emphasizes Lyn&amp;#39;s personal philosophy: With enough determination, anything is possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YOUR VOTE IS MAGIC! contains many visuals that enrich the story, including photos of the animal &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot; and the preparations for the illusion.  There are provocative quotes about voting from famous folk; whimsical political cartoons; and an absorbing review of the successful woman&amp;#39;s suffrage movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the title implies, it&amp;#39;s truly a MAGICAL COMBINATION of illusion and reality and delivers a colorful, persuasive message to first-time voters.  This book will be happily passed along to NEW GENERATIONS of voters as they begin their journey to responsible citizenship." />
