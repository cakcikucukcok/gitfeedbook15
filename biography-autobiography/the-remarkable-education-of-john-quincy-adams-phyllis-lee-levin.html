  <title>The Remarkable Education of John Quincy Adams - Phyllis Lee Levin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A patriot by birth, John Quincy Adams&#39;s destiny was foreordained. He was not only &quot;The Greatest Traveler of His Age,&quot; but his country&#39;s most gifted linguist and most experienced diplomat. John Quincy&#39;s world encompassed the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the early and late Napoleonic Age. As his diplomat father&#39;s adolescent clerk and secretary, he met everyone who was anyone in Europe, including America&#39;s own luminaries and founding fathers, Franklin and Jefferson. All this made coming back to America a great challenge. But though he was determined to make his own career he was soon embarked, at Washington&#39;s appointment, on his phenomenal work abroad, as well as on a deeply troubled though loving and enduring marriage. But through all the emotional turmoil, he dedicated his life to serving his country. At 50, he returned to America to serve as Secretary of State to President Monroe. He was inaugurated President in 1824, after which he served as a stirring defender of the slaves of the Amistad rebellion and as a member of the House of Representatives from 1831 until his death in 1848. In &lt;i&gt;The Remarkable Education of John Quincy Adams&lt;/i&gt;, Phyllis Lee Levin provides the deeply researched and beautifully written definitive biography of one of the most fascinating and towering early Americans." />
