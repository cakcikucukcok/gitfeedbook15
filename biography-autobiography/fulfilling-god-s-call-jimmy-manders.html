  <title>Fulfilling God’S Call - Jimmy Manders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Bible says in Proverbs 13:15, Good understanding giveth favor: but the way of transgressors is hard.  If we go to hell, we have to go by the preachers sermons, by your mothers prayers, and most of all by Calvary. I&#39;m so thankful that God saved me and changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Manderss hearts desire is to tell the lost about the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, so that all can  receive salvation and be saved from the wrath and judgments of God. They are soon coming upon all sinners and unbelievers and all those who refuse to believe on the Son of God.
With a great desire to do something for the Lord, he preached his first sermon in a little army tent, and he has since traveled to fifteen countries and is now pastor at Grace &amp; Truth Church in Dawsonville, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Manderss dream was to have a church like the Murrayville Revival Center where he got saved. The Lord showed him in a night vision that it was his perfect will, so he started working toward it with no money, just a step of faith. It has been the Lords to make a way from a storefront to a cabinet shop that we renovated that is now a beautiful church. Through much prayer and sacrifice, now the vision has come to pass. Teamwork makes the dream work!&lt;/p&gt;" />
