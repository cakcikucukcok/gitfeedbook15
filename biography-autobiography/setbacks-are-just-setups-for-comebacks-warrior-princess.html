  <title>Setbacks Are Just  Setups for  Comebacks - Warrior Princess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In doing this job, I found out that its not the nature of this occupation that is the problem. Its the people you work with who can cause issues. My job is what I loved and still love. This is what I have worked hard for to help the less fortunate by getting an understanding of how the line is so thin and anyone could be caught up in it. I write my story based on my experience in my place of work. There comes a time when your managers try to set you up by sleeping with your colleagues, and then due to them having a work relationship, they use that to get you out of your job. Or there comes a time that you realize how you have been looked down on and left to be bullied because they know that the manager will not do anything to help you due to the fact that your faith wont let you violate your morals. They persecute you for your belief that you dont do the same things which others do. 
I have been lied to so badly until I have gone through court cases but walked away free from being lied on by managers and their lovers and not get in the mess of the offices lewd sexual behaviours. I have gone through everythingunfair dismissal, criminal case, employment caseand this is an account on how I got through all these. I stood my ground with my faith. Through prayers and fasting and believing in the Word of God, I got through the hardships of the day-to-day life of what I can only call racial discrimination, harassment, and bullying. With my story, you can see how I got through it and lived my life and grew stronger in faith and my walk with Jesus.
I was blessed with new friends who supported my growth and pushed my skills to becoming a writer and to share my story. I just want to encourage you that by reading my story, you will see that there is a way out over bullying and you dont have to feel ashamed in what happened to you. You have to know that it is all right to tell your story and unlock the secret door that employers tend to put under the rug. We employees have to put a foot down and say when enough is enough and hold our head up because there is a law in the land that says its wrong in this day and age for people to be rampantly doing injustice to their subordinates." />
