  <title>Budget Backpacking for Boomers - Alastair Henry, Candas Whitlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you remember a time in your youth when you set off to see the world with only a pack on your back and limited funds in your pocket?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s what we did, but we did it when we were in our mid-sixties! With only a backpack and little planning, we set off and explored Central America and Southeast Asia for four months at a time, and did it on a shoe-string budget: In Central America, we spent less than $40 per day per person for food, accommodation and travel; and in Southeast Asia, less than $30 per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, we show you how we did it: where we went, where we stayed, how we travelled and, most importantly, how little we paid. We also share stories about the interesting people we met; give you tips on how to save dollars; and tell you about the fascinating sights we discovered on &amp;ldquo;roads less traveled&amp;rdquo; as we ventured through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama for four months in 2011, and through Bali, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand for four months in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paperback version of this book also contains forty-four beautiful photos to inspire and motivate you; three summaries of where we stayed, their amenities and how much we paid; seven color maps of the countries we visited, as well as an index of cities and towns for easy referencing&lt;/p&gt;" />
