  <title>Finding Chika - Mitch Albom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitch Albom has done it again with this moving memoir of love and loss. You can&amp;#8217;t help but fall for Chika. A page-turner that will no doubt become a classic.&amp;#8221; --Mary Karr, author of &lt;em&gt;The Liars&amp;#8217; Club&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Art of Memoir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Tuesdays With Morrie&lt;/em&gt; comes Mitch Albom&amp;#8217;s most personal story to date: an intimate and heartwarming memoir about what it means to be a family and the young Haitian orphan whose short life would forever change his heart.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in a landscape of extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to The Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Albom operates in Port Au Prince.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; With no children of their own, the forty-plus children who live, play, and go to school at the orphanage have become family to Mitch and his wife, Janine. Chika&amp;#8217;s arrival makes a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delights the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika is suddenly diagnosed with something a doctor there says, &amp;#8220;No one in Haiti can help you with.&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Mitch and Janine bring Chika to Detroit, hopeful that American medical care can soon return her to her homeland. Instead, Chika becomes a permanent part of their household, and their lives, as they embark on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika&amp;#8217;s boundless optimism and humor teach Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learns that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable. Finding Chika is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed&amp;#8212;a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.&lt;/p&gt;" />
