  <title>My Father is a Book: A Memoir of Bernard Malamud - Janna Malamud Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Bernard Malamud was one of the most accomplished American novelists of the postwar years. From the Pulitzer Prize winner &lt;I&gt;The Fixer&lt;/I&gt; as well as &lt;I&gt;The Assistant&lt;/I&gt;, named one of the best &quot;100 All-Time Novels&quot; by &lt;I&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#151;to mention only two of the more than a dozen published books&amp;#151;he not only established himself in the first rank of American writers but also took the country&#39;s literature in new and important directions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In her signature memoir, Smith explores her renowned father&#39;s life and literary legacy. Malamud was among the most brilliant novelists of his era, and counted among his friends Philip Roth, Saul Bellow, Theodore Roethke, and Shirley Jackson. Yet Malamud was also very private. Only his family has had full access to his personal papers, including letters and journals that offer unique insight into the man and his work. In her candid, evocative, and loving memoir, his daughter brings Malamud to vivid life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
