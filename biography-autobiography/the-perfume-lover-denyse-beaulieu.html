  <title>The Perfume Lover - Denyse Beaulieu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Perfume Lover&lt;/i&gt; is a candid personal account of the process of composing a fragrance, filled with sensual scent descriptions, sexy tidbits, and historical vignettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the most beautiful night in your life inspired a perfume? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Denyse Beaulieu was growing up near Montreal, perfume was forbidden in her house, spurring a childhood curiosity that became an intellectual and sensual passion. It is this passion she pursued all the way to Paris, where she now lives, and which led her to become a respected fragrance writer. But little did she know that it would also lead her to achieve a perfume lover&#39;s wildest dream: When Denyse tells famous perfumer Betrand Duchaufour at L&#39;Artisan Parfumeur of a sensual night spent in Seville under a blossoming orange tree, wrapped in the arms of a beautiful man, the story stirs his imagination and together they create a scent that captures the essence of that night. As their unique creative collaboration unfolds, the perfume-in-progress conjures intimate memories, leading Beaulieu to make sense of her life through scents. Throughout the book, she weaves the evocative history of perfumery into her personal journey, in an intensely passionate voice: the masters and the masterpieces, the myths and the myth-busting, down to the molecular mysteries that weld our flesh to flowers.&lt;br&gt;Now, just to set your nostrils aquiver: &lt;i&gt;Séville à l&#39;aube&lt;/i&gt; is an orange blossom oriental with zesty, green and balsamic effects, with notes of petitgrain, petitgrain citronnier, orange blossom, beeswax, incense, and lavender, and is now available at fragrance outlets in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;" />
