  <title>Paving the Road to Success - R. L. Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fifty years ago, Richard L. &quot;Dick&quot; Nelson started his career with a small loader.&lt;br&gt;
He established his business in Princeton, Illinois, a small rural community with a current population of 7,600. &lt;br&gt;
today, he is the founder of Nelson Enterprises which includes Advanced Asphalt Company, TCI Manufacturing and Sales, Tri-Con Materials, Northwest Illinois Construction LLC, Pavement Maintenance Services, Inc., D&amp;J Leasing and AAA Aviation LLC. &lt;br&gt;
Nelson Enterprises has achieved $1.5 billion in total sales, has worldwide patent recognition, employs approximately 300 people and rents 100 trucks a day during construction season.&lt;br&gt;
Dick is the son of Malcolm and Frances Nelson (both deceased) and was raised in Princeton with five siblings (three of whom are deceased).&lt;br&gt;
He is a graduate of Princeton High School and served in the Army.&lt;br&gt;
He and his wife, Judy, have three grown children, Leanne (Jeff) Martin, Laurie Wallace and Steve (Gina) Nelson. They also have four grandchildren, Nicole Martin, Kelsey Wallace, Colin and Audrey Nelson.&lt;br&gt;
Dick attributes much of his success to his &quot;team&quot; of talented and dedicated professionals.&lt;br&gt;
He has also achieved success and national awards because of his God given mechanical talent, hard work, determination and what he calls a &quot;Bachelor of Common Sense Degree from Life University&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
Dick has contributed a multitude of volunteer service hours to the Princeton Park Board, United Way, Cub Scouts, Little League and St. Matthew&#39;s Church.&lt;br&gt;
His passion is flying. And to that end, he built his own helicopter.&lt;br&gt;
In honor of his 50th anniversary in business, an open house was held to recognize his &quot;team&quot; and business milestones. At this event, the Nelson family established an annual scholarship at Princeton High School for a senior student planning to attend a vocational school.&lt;br&gt;
Doug Oberhelman, CEO of Caterpillar, was also in attendance at the open house and announced that Caterpillar will match the Nelson family annual scholarship. This is a tribute to the Nelson family and Nelson Enterprises for service to the community, central Illinois and the State of Illinois.&lt;br&gt;" />
