  <title>Life After My Saucepans - Lindsay de Feliz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;About Your Saucepans? &lt;/em&gt;Lindsay de Feliz gave up marriage and a successful career in the UK to follow her dreams as a scuba diving instructor in the Dominican Republic. She met and married her Dominican man and went on an incredible adventure involving political corruption and being shot in her own home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life After My Saucepans &lt;/em&gt;continues the story with Lindsay and Danilo living in hiding, away from the beaches and tourist resorts, in the mountainous, remote, sparsely populated north-west of the country. Will Danilo return to politics, will they turn their lives around and will they adapt to their new surroundings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While visitors will recognise the descriptions of local men who scam foreign women (sanky pankys), they will also experience a different side of the country from Lindsay&amp;rsquo;s colourful narrative where the friendly, yet quirky, nature of the Dominican people is uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of incident, adventure, laughter and tears Lindsay describes her day-to-day life with her indomitable husband Danilo, as she comes to realise this is where she has always meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
