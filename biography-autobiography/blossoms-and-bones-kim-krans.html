Krans has taken refuge from herself in an ashram for thirty days. During those thirty days, she has the urge to “draw the feeling”. Every day for thirty days, she puts pen to paper and draws her emotions. As Krans puts pen to paper, we are witness to her unravelling.<br /><b><i>Blossoms and Bones: Drawing a Life Back Together: Krans ...</i></b> | A painful, yet triumphantly beautiful read, Blossoms and Bones is an intimate perspective on addiction, disordered eating, heartbreak, and ultimately, on self-compassion. It reveals how an individual person's spiritual breakthrough can arise through the darkest, most challenging personal trials. Kim Krans' work is truly a gift.<br /><b><i>Blossoms and Bones: Drawing a Life Back Together by Kim Krans</i></b> | “ Blossoms and Bones describes what it’s like to have an eating disorder in a way I’ve never seen described before—the sudden, out-of-the-blue obsession with food and the sudden inability to recognize oneself through the obsession.
