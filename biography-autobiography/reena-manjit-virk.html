  <title>Reena - Manjit Virk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Shortlisted for the 2009 George Ryga Award.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of an average family that has never been the same . . . since its eldest child was swarmed and killed by her peers on a moonlit night, November 14, 1997 . . . It is the story of what sudden and horrific violence can do to a family, and how a family somehow remains intact in the face of such events. —from the prologue by Lynne Van Luven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of their 14-year-old daughter Reena’s murder, Manjit and Suman Virk had already been let down by both social-services and law-enforcement authorities. They had struggled with the challenges of conflicting cultures and religions and child-rearing ideologies, and with the anguish of allegations of wrongdoing and the tarnished reputations that resulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Manjit speaks for the first time about life before and after the murder of Reena, a tragedy that remains one of the most widely discussed crimes of our time. It is a book about what was and what was not, about his immigration to a new land and his attempts to raise his family in a safe and simple fashion, about the events that forever derailed those efforts. &lt;/p&gt;" />
