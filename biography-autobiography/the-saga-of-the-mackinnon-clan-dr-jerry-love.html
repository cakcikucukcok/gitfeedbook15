  <title>The Saga of the Mackinnon Clan - Dr. Jerry Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This novel begins in the eighteenth century with the first generation of an imaginary extended 
Family and how well documented historical events prompt the family to seek a better way of life. The family initially resides in the British Isles and with the passage of time migrates to the new world in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It continues with the adventures and experiences of two brothers who, after four years of combat in the Civil War, decide to establish a new life in the Wyoming Territory where they meet and marry two beautiful young ladies. The sensual love shared by one of the brothers and his beautiful bride on their wedding night is described in detail, a deep love they experience throughout their adult life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After building a successful cattle ranch, they are faced with challenges associated with prote9ting their property from politically active large ranching interests determined to annihilate them with every means at their disposal, whether inside or outside of the law. The determined intent of the large ranchers to destroy the small ranchers results in an all out war that is eventua1ly won by the small ranchers with the support of the duly elected law enforcement officials, determined to wipe out all illegal activities such as lynchings and cattle rustling.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The principal activities of the novel occur in the northeastern frontier area of the Wyoming 
Territory, where the breathtaking Bighorn Mountains cast a shadow over the Powder River 
Basin, long recognized as one of the most desirable cattle grazing areas in the country.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although life on an isolated frontier ranch is often thought of as being very boring with an aster life style, there are many available amenities that the two brother and their two families thoroughly enjoy as described in the novel. These include country style dancing such as the polka, waltz, and the two step, hunting big game including elk, bighorn sheep, and antelope, horse-back riding, bird hunting, fly fishing for trout, and enjoyable experiences associated with visits to large western cities such as Denver and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;" />
