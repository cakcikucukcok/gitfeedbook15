  <title>Whitman Revisited - Frank Jakubowsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is very unusual for an author to number parts of his poems. Walt Whitmans poem, Song of Myself, has 52 parts, which he numbered 1 to 52. This book uses that idea that Whitman numbered his poems in his book, Leaves of Grass. I have found that Jesus wrote his parables that are in a cycle of ten. My book, &lt;em&gt;The Psychological Patterns of Jesus Christ&lt;/em&gt;, shows how these parables relate to that pattern. I also found that other people are writing in that same pattern, and I say that it relates to the influence of the Spirit of Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitmans numbers are also in a cycle of ten. His numbers 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51 would relate to a part number 1 of the cycle of ten. I also have numbered the ten parts of Jesus cycle. It just happens that our numberings are the same. So Whitmans 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51 and my discovery of Jesus pattern of number 1, enlighten has the same quality. These are how the numbers relate to the parts, which I gave key words to describe the part. 1. enlighten; 2. inadequacy; 3. expansive; 4. fruitful; 5. authoritative; 6. communication; 7. reject; 8. sociable; 9. spiritual; 10. action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over the last single numbers that Whitman numbered, we can see some relationship to Jesus key words. For example, the word sun seems to happen quite often in numbers 5, 15, 25, etc. that relates to the key word of &lt;em&gt;authoritative&lt;/em&gt; which seems just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The match of numbers and the cycle of ten gives a good indication that Walt Whitman was influenced by the spirit of truth. Walt put on the mind of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
