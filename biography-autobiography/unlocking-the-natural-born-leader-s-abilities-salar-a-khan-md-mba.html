  <title>Unlocking the Natural-Born Leader’S Abilities - Salar A. Khan Md Mba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Leaders orchestrate commands to people in order to accomplish objectives pertinent and in accordance with their personal principles and intentions. This book sets to identify the qualities and abilities of a certain kind of leader, which I refer to as the natural-born leader (NBL). The NBL possesses innate traits, refined and perfected over time with education, training, and experience. I will attempt to illustrate these traits by drawing from my fifty years of personal experiences and hope readers will look at this as an opportunity to introspect. I have also designed a self-assessment tool so you may self-evaluate the presence of these NBL abilities and identify where you ultimately fall on the spectrum.Today, there is widespread lack of confidence in leadership whether in business, government, education, or elsewhere. The vision of a confident leader, that of an NBL, is needed for the betterment of the world.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doctorsalarkhan.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.doctorsalarkhan.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
