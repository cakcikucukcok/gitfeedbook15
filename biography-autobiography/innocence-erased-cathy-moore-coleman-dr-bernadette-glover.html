  <title>Innocence Erased - Cathy Moore-Coleman, Dr. Bernadette Glover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cissy is a typical young girl, one who loves her family, her friends, and her toys. But one day, she experienced something that no child should ever endureand it was the beginning of a nightmare for her. Against her will and beyond her ability to comprehend, Cissy found herself at the center of a growing epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The impact of her abuse left her with insecurities and low self-esteem, devaluing herself, not realizing her potential and worth. Cissy grew up with self-doubt, and as a direct result of the selfish acts of sexual predators, her choices became increasingly self-destructive. The inability to make better choices, Cissy soon found herself directly and indirectly associated with murderers, drug dealers and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the darkness of her childhood would eventually be banished by the embrace of the Only One who could change her course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Innocence Erased&lt;/i&gt; is not just about Cissy, one child who was the victim of sexual abuse; it is about all children who have lived through this violence. Included are tools designed to help educate parents, guardians, and children. Even a single act against a child can redirect their course of life forever, however, there is help, hope, and healing available for survivors." />
