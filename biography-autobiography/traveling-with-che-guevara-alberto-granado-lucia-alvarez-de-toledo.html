  <title>Traveling with Che Guevara - Alberto Granado, Lucia Alvarez de Toledo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Published for the first time in the U.S.&amp;#8212;one of the two diaries on which the movie &lt;em&gt;The Motorcycle Diaries&lt;/em&gt; is based&amp;#8212;the moving and at times hilarious account of Che Guevara and Alberto Granado&#39;s eight-month tour of South America in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1952 Alberto Granado, a young doctor, and his friend Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student from a distinguished Buenos Aires family, decided to explore their continent. They set off from Cordoba in Argentina on a Norton 500cc motorbike and traveled through Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. The duo&#39;s adventures vary from the suspenseful (stowing away on a cargo ship, exploring Incan ruins) to the comedic (falling in love, drinking, fighting...) to the serious (volunteering as firemen and at a leper colony). They worked as day laborers along the way&amp;#8212;as soccer coaches, medical assistants, and furniture movers. The poverty and exploitation of the native population started the process that was to turn Ernesto&amp;#8212;the debonair, fun-loving student&amp;#8212;into Che, the revolutionary who had a profound impact on the history of several nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally published in Spanish in Cuba in 1978, the first English translation was published by Random House UK in 2003. The movie, based on Granado&#39;s and Che&#39;s diaries, directed by Walter Salles (&lt;em&gt;Central Station&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Behind the Sun&lt;/em&gt;), was produced by Robert Redford and others. Shown at the Sundance Film Festival, it generated great reviews and a frenzied auction for distribution rights, which was won by Focus Features. Granado, now 82, was a consultant to Salles during the production. 10 b/w photos.&lt;/p&gt;" />
