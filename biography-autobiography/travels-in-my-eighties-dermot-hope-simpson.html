  <title>Travels in My Eighties - Dermot Hope-Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After my wife died, I decided to remain active, including travelling. This book is an account of twelve journeys I made over the four years since then, and it is liberally illustrated with my photographs. Many of these journeys were individual but some were group tours. The places visited include various parts of Turkey, in particular the eastern part of that country. It also includes visits to Jordan, Albania, Uzbekistan, Warsaw, Iran, the former Russian Republic of Georgia, Kosovo, and Armenia with Nagorno Karabagh. 
I am still travelling, and in 2013, I went to Myanmar (Burma), Bulgaria, and the semi-autonomous province of Iraqi Kurdistan. In the last of these, we found ourselves to be the first tourist group ever to visit and as a result were greeted by the Minister of Tourism and the collected representatives of the local press and television networks." />
