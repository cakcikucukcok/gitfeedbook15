  <title>The Misadventures of an Old Saddle Tramp - Robert Schweiger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="R. J. Schweiger is eighty-one years old.  He has traveled many paths during his lifetime, but he always seemed to end up on horseback.
Among other things, Mr. Bob has been a freelance writer.  He has written articles for The American Field, The Western Horseman, and Gun Dog.
His involvement in field trials and horse shows meant extensive travel, and it wasnt unusual for him to log thirty thousand miles a year on the road.  His equipment was well worn, and every trip was an adventure.
Mr. Bobs exploits have earned him a Life Patrons Award from the National Bird Dog Foundation in Grand Junction, Tennessee, and a Charter Membership in an international organization called the Long Riders Guild, which is based in France.
Mr. Bob moved to Alabama in 1989 with plans to just make it his winter home.  But now he has settled down permanently in the town of Hurtsboro, where he has served as a constable.  He now serves as a special deputy sheriff in Russell County." />
