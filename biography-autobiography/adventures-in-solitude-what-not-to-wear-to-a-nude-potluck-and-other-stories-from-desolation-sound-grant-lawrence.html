  <title>Adventures in Solitude: What Not to Wear to a Nude Potluck and Other Stories from Desolation Sound - Grant Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From Captain George Vancouver to Muriel &amp;#147;&lt;I&gt;Curve of Time&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8221; Blanchet to Jim &amp;#147;&lt;I&gt;Spilsbury&amp;#8217;s Coast&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8221; Spilsbury, visitors to Desolation Sound have left behind a trail of books endowing the area with a romantic aura that helps to make it British Columbia&amp;#8217;s most popular marine park. In this hilarious and captivating book, CBC personality Grant Lawrence adds a whole new chapter to the saga of this storied piece of BC coastline.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Young Grant&amp;#8217;s father bought a piece of land next to the park in the 1970s, just in time to encounter the gun-toting cougar lady, left-over hippies, outlaw bikers and an assortment of other characters. In those years Desolation Sound was a place where going to the neighbours&amp;#8217; potluck meant being met with hugs from portly naked hippies and where Russell the Hermit&amp;#8217;s school of life (boating, fishing, and rock &amp;#8217;n&amp;#8217; roll) was Grant&amp;#8217;s personal Enlightenment&amp;#151;an influence that would take him away from the coast to a life of music and journalism and eventually back again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With rock band buddies and a few cases of beer in tow, an older, cooler Grant returns to regale us with tales of &amp;#147;going bush,&amp;#8221; the tempting dilemma of finding an unguarded grow-op, and his awkward struggle to convince a couple of visiting kayakers that he&amp;#8217;s a legit CBC radio host while sporting a wild beard and body wounds and gesticulating with a machete. With plenty of laugh-out-loud humour and inspired reverence, &lt;I&gt;Adventures in Solitude&lt;/I&gt; delights us with the unique history of a place and the growth of a young man amidst the magic of Desolation Sound.&lt;/div&gt;" />
