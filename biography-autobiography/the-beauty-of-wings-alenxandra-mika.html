  <title>The Beauty of Wings - Alenxandra Mika</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Beauty of Wings&lt;/i&gt; is a magical true story of inner transformation. It unravels the details of author Alexandra Mikas healing journey, from an excruciatingly painful childhood of bullying, exclusion, and asthma to her mid-twenties filled with anorexia, pneumonia, panic, and suffocation to near death. Through dedication and determination Alexandra propels herself out of dark waters and comes home to her natural state of bliss, radiant health, and love. Journey with Alexandra on a pilgrimage of self-awakening through Reiki (energy healing), a profound connection with an extraordinary horse, connecting deeply with the natural world, yoga, and learning to love herself unconditionally. Through the metaphor of lungs as butterfly wings, readers journey from the dark isolation of the cocoon into the freedom and majestic nature of the butterfly. &lt;i&gt;The Beauty of Wings&lt;/i&gt; reveals the unlimited potential of the human spirit and the capacity within the heart for healing, transformation, and unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Beauty of Wings&lt;/i&gt; is the story of an incredible journey of inner awakening, a story concerned with the task of learning to love oneself. This remarkable young woman has achieved what we would call speaking oneself into being through aligning her inner and outer speech with positive thinking and rising above any and all of lifes obstacles through determination. Her true story demonstrates the power of consistent positive thoughts to heal the body, heal the mind, and to positively change ones life. Pia Smith Orleane &amp; Cullen Baird Smith, authors of Conversations With Laarkmaa, Remembering Who We Are and The Return of the Feminine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great courage and honesty, Alexandra shares from the heart her story of struggle and pain, to surrender, healing and empowerment. From suffering to triumph, she speaks her truth and grows her wings to fly to new heights spreading the message of hope and beauty, as do the butterflies that have always been with her. Tara Cindy Sherman, ERYT-500&lt;/p&gt;" />
