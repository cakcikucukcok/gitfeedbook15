  <title>Finished It - Cassie Reilly-Boccia, Kayla Braud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Finished It&lt;/i&gt; unlocks the Alabama Softball story in a transparent and powerful way. Her stories are woven together creating the sensation you are living and learning what makes Alabama Softball special. This book shares how Coach Patrick Murphy, Coach Aly Habetz and staff have cornered the market on RELEVANT leadership. Unwavering values that withstand the test of time in an ever changing society.  Her book pulls back the curtain on one of  NCAA Softballs greatest collegiate programs.&lt;p&gt;
Sue Enquist&lt;br&gt;
Former UCLA Softball Coach-27 yrs.&lt;br&gt;
11-Time National Champion&lt;br&gt;
5-Time Hall of Fame&lt;p&gt;
Been around this amazing game for awhile, and few have ever taken us inside the true emotion, process, preparation and understanding of what it takes to win on the biggest stage. Cassie does this so uniquely, you will find yourself applying to your own life the creative ways this special group was able to succeed both as an underdog in THE championship moment and as a difference maker in life.&lt;p&gt;
Jessica Mendoza&lt;br&gt;
ESPN Analyst and Reporter, &lt;br&gt;
Olympic Silver and Gold Medalist&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Finished It&lt;/i&gt; shows us there is more to winning a national championship than meets the eye the day that trophy is hoisted. Discovering the details of raw emotion and effort that goes into winning a national championship is nothing short of motivational. You can see the Alabama Softball program has developed a formula for not only winning games, but the effort it takes to develop a healthy, inspiring lockerroom from day one of a season. Any athlete, any person would be able to relate to the dedication, creativity, passion and belief in each other this team had from the get-go of their magical season.&lt;p&gt;
Amanda Scarborough&lt;br&gt;
2-Time All-American &lt;br&gt;
ESPN College Softball Analyst&lt;p&gt;
Although little can prepare you for adversity, this book will show you that when you have twenty hearts beating as one, nothing can stop you.&lt;p&gt;
