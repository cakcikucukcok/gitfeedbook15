Living high above the sea, with a 180-degree vista of the great Pacific with his wife of 32 years, three dogs Caramel, Maile 2 and Duke and two cats Ginger and Cocoa, he pursued some land adventures.  Enjoying the good life in paradise, he headed up and navigated the Neighborhood Watch for 15 years and the Ranchos Road Maintenance Corporation for 10 years in the town of Ocean View meeting many challenges with much enthusiasm, sharing knowledge, and attaining many goals for the community.
