  <title>I Am Still a Woman - Jim Kilpatrick, Nina-Ann McCurley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am Nina-Ann McCurley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in a small town, an average woman living my life day to day. Twelve years ago, as I watched my mother waste away and die of ovarian cancer, I felt the pain of losing someone so dear and loving to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didnt know then was that I would have to face my own battle with cancer one daynot once, but twice. I love my life and my three sons, and I didnt want to leave them as my mother had left me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my story, my battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was forty-three years olda keen sailor and tennis player who ran my own marketing business from homewhen I got my diagnosis. I am fortunate to be surrounded by family and friends who stand beside me when I need a helping hand. With their love and support, I took on the battle with a heart filled with the desire to live and watch my boys grow into men. I know my journey has made a difference to my family and friends. Now I want to reach out to others who are facing the same terrible journey. I want to tell my story and inspire those women who are standing on the brink of their own battle with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is too precious to let a disease win. You have to battle it as you battle any other event trying to overpower you: with love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
