  <title>Breaking the Silence - Martin Ridge, Gerard Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Assigned to a quiet corner of Ireland&#39;s most remote county, Martin Ridge was heading for retirement after a long career with An Garda S&amp;iacute;och&amp;aacute;na, the Irish police force. All that changed when a call from a local priest set in motion what would become the most horrific sex abuse investigation the island had ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Christmas 1997 a local priest Fr Eugene Greene reported to the Gardaí that a man had tried to blackmail him. This call, an act of hubris, set in motion a Garda investigation that revealed him to be a serial abuser of children. As word of the investigation spread, 26 men came forward. Most were from the tiny Irish-speaking parish of Gort an Choirce. All had been abused by Greene as children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, another man came forward to say that he had been sexually abused by a local schoolteacher, Denis McGinley. As Ridge dug deeper, he discovered that McGinley had been systematically abusing children in his classroom for decades. He had at least 50 victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greene and McGinley cases both involved the Catholic Church. Greene was a priest, and McGinley a teacher in a Catholic school answerable to religious managers. As Ridge investigated, he discovered that the Church knew about the abuse, but ignored the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliantly written and unsparing in its fidelity to the truth, &lt;i&gt;Breaking the Silence&lt;/i&gt; is more than an account of a police investigation: it’s the story of an entire community’s struggle to come to terms with its betrayal by those in whom it placed the most trust.&lt;/p&gt;" />
