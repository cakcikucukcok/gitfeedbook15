  <title>Broken and Made Whole - Micki Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the dawn of the 50s came a new sound in music, Rock and Roll. Micki was in high school immersed in art, music, volleyball and drinking vanilla cokes. Growing up, with her sister, in a house on the north side of Chicago, her early years were happy, except for problems between her parents. They attended church so the Bible and faith in God became her source of comfort.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Swept off her feet, she married at eighteen and had a son. Shattered, when the marriage failed, an encounter with the living Christ, set the stage for complete restoration. Step by step, the broken pieces of her life were put together. As a single mom, she earned her teaching degree and watched as God provided a home, a devoted husband, a beautiful daughter and unexpected opportunities to serve God in Europe. The Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, teaching English in Paris, Estonia, and camps in Poland and Romania are just a few of the places which provide fascinating reading in this book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micki shares the impact of unexpected illness and the journey she is on, focusing on what lies ahead, knowing that her faith will lead her to meet Jesus, face to face.&lt;/p&gt;" />
