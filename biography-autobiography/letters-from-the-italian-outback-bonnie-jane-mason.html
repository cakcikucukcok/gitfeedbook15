  <title>Letters from the Italian Outback - Bonnie-Jane Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bonnie-Jane McCabe (now Mason) lived this book.  She wrote these letters to her family during one exciting year in her young life. Years later, she started the book, collected the letters, copied them to her computer, and organized her book in her computer. It always needed just one more editing pass to make sure its error-free.  Before she was finished, a disastrous computer-crash appeared to her, to have ended her book project.
This version, published from a recently rediscovered, early paper preview draft, is my gift to Bonnie, my daughter.
