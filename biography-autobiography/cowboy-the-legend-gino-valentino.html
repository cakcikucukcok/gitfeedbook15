  <title>Cowboy: the Legend - Gino Valentino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story begins in Colma, California. Colma is a small town south of San Francisco, California. There were many adventures, which took a diamentrically opposite course of action! My life was surrounded with ups and downs. My story becomes a living nighmare for me the flasbacks became more terrifying and the nightmares came more realistic. The story will mystify you! It will become more confusing, with all the bizarre endings. Two girl friends died, one was murdered!
When I was a rookie police officer, I was inadvertently involved with a serial killer!
Two years later, from 1972 to 1975, I was involved with the mob. I had no other choice was I a crooked cop? If I didnt cooperate with them, I wouldnt be alive today! I found out later, there was a conspiracy against me! Not only I go t fired as a policeman, later I got arrested. 
Later on, I made my miracle comeback in politics. I made California history, by winning the town election!
When both of my parents died, I inherited millions of dollars which changed my life drastically! Do you believe all these events happened to one person. That is unbelievable! Life is unpredictable and mysterious, if I did not get arrested in 1976 and four years later made my miracle comeback in politics. This book never would have been written. 
I have a unique way of writing. I continue to talk to the reader thoughout the story. This special writing technique keeps the reader involved in my story. 
When I lived in Reno, Nevada, I started betting ten or twenty thousand dollars a day. The casino workers started calling me cowboy. That name became famous in northern Nevada! The cowboy was involved in many terrifying and dangerous events. The fear and sensations throbbing through my body, made me a dangerous man. Especially, when I became a bounty hunter. I was a gun collector. Therefore, I had many weapons! 
I believed it was my duty to go after the person that murdered my girl friend and I knew who he was! 
My story will keep you in suspense from the beginning to the end. The rise and fall of a legend! The cowboy will always be a legend in northern Nevada. The name cowboy will live forever! 
If you are a book reader, you must read this book. I promise you will not regret it!" />
