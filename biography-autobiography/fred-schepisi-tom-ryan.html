  <title>Fred Schepisi - Tom Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, Stephen Schiff has described Fred Schepisi (b. 1939) as &amp;#8220;probably the least-known great director working in the mainstream American cinema&amp;#8212;a master storyteller with a serenely muscular style that can make more flamboyant moviemakers look coarse and overweening.&amp;#8221; Schepisi&amp;#8217;s launch in Australia during the country&amp;#8217;s film renaissance of the 1970s and his ongoing international work have rightfully earned him a reputation as an actors&amp;#8217; director. But he has also become a skillful stylist, forging his own way as he works alongside a talented team of collaborators.&lt;p&gt;This volume includes twenty interviews with Schepisi and two with longtime collaborators, cinematographer Ian Baker and composer Paul Grabowsky. The interviews trace the filmmaker&amp;#8217;s career from his beginnings in advertising, through his two early Australian features&amp;#8212;&lt;i&gt;The Devil&amp;#8217;s Playground&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8212;to his subsequent work in the United States and beyond on films as various as &lt;i&gt;Plenty&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Roxanne&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A Cry in the Dark&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Russia House&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Six Degrees of Separation&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Empire Falls&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Last Orders&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/i&gt;. Schepisi&amp;#8217;s films are diverse thematically and visually. In what is effectively a master class on film direction, Schepisi discusses his creative choices and his work with actors and collaborators behind the scenes. In the process, he provides a goldmine of insights into his films, his filmmaking style, and what makes him tick as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
