      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before she was mother to global superstar Demi Lovato, she was just Dianna Hart. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dianna tells her story from the very beginning in this complete and genuinely affecting memoir. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had big plans of becoming a country music star, but her life went in a  different direction than her dreams. She developed an eating disorder  early in life to gain a sense of control in her strict upbringing. As  she continued to struggle with body image and her obsession with being  perfect her entire adult life, she was also met with other difficult  situations. Her husband and father of her two eldest daughters, Dallas and Demi, had his own troubles that effected the entire family. She coped  with alcohol and pills, forming a long-lasting addiction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s had terrible lows but also some great highs as she watched her daughters break out in Hollywood to become strong, empowered young women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a mother caring for daughters with addictions while continuing to battle her own, Dianna offers a unique perspective. And as a family, they  have survived everything life has thrown at them and come away from it stronger than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dianna tells her story of living through and surviving adversity--with tremendous strength, love and faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
