  <title>Mister Tony’S Journey Through and Beyond Cancer - Tony Power</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While celebrating his fortieth birthday in Las Vegas, author Tony Powers life changed forever. You have cancer. Those three words started his life down a completely different path. Tony was struck down with bilateral kidney cancer and given thirty days to live. But he fought against the odds, defying his thirty days to live sentence and refusing to allow cancer to defeat him. &lt;i&gt;Mister Tonys Journey through and beyond Cancer &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of his journey down a road that no one thought he would return from and how, by the grace of God, he is still here today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fateful trip in October of 2004 was the beginning of a nightmare for Tony Power. With the help of his friend Paul C. Fisher and his doctor, Dr. Mark Rowe, he returned to Ireland. When he got off the plane, he went straight to the Mater Hospital in Dublin to see the surgeon. He told him practically the same thing that he was told in Las Vegasthat he had a deadly form of cancer with thirty days to live. Even so, Tony fought back and has been fighting every since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir chronicles the experience and trials his cancer has brought himmany crosses to bear and a continuing battle to wage. Eight years, he is still fighting the battle against cancerand, against the odds, hes winning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
