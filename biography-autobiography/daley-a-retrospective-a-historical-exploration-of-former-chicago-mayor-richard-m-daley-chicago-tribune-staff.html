  <title>Daley: A Retrospective: A Historical Exploration of Former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley - Chicago Tribune Staff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From the second half of the twentieth century through today, no family has defined Chicago in the public&#39;s eye more than the Daleys. Between Richard J. Daley and his son, Richard M. Daley, a member of this prominent Bridgeport family served as the city&#39;s mayor for 43 out of a total 57 years from 1955&amp;#150;2011. When Richard M. Daley, also known as &quot;Richie&quot;, made a surprise announcement in 2011 that he would not seek re-election, he had surpassed his father&#39;s record tenure of 21 years in office. &lt;I&gt;Daley: A Retrospective&lt;/I&gt; explores the fascinating, storied career of Richard M. Daley: the longest-serving, and arguably, most important mayor in the city&#39;s own long, storied history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From Richie&#39;s childhood in his father&#39;s shadow to his infamous teenaged run-in with the law, this book begins with the earliest years in the life of Richard J. Daley&#39;s eldest son. It follows the rise of Daley&#39;s political career as a state senator and as the state&#39;s attorney through his 1989 election as mayor. The bulk of &lt;I&gt;Daley: A Retrospective&lt;/I&gt; focuses on Daley&#39;s lengthy, imperial reign over Chicago politics, in which he developed his own unique and powerful personality. Transitioning from a perceived simulacrum of his father into one of the most dominant, idiosyncratic, and quotable individuals in American politics, Daley made his name by making bold moves, waging hard-fought battles, and forging commanding, if not celebrated, consensus between the multitudes of citywide officials and organizations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Comprised of 60 years of &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt; reporting, this story is unique to Chicago and told by none better than the reporters, editors, and notable commentators who covered Daley&#39;s entire career. Touching on race relations, education, gang violence, crime, environmentalism, gay marriage, local sports, and the murky world of Chicago politics, &lt;I&gt;Daley: A Retrospective&lt;/I&gt; is a captivating read. It is the most up-to-date and comprehensive exploration of Mayor Richard M. Daley&#39;s legacy, and it will serve as a significant resource as Daley continues to be reexamined and reevaluated for years to come.&lt;/div&gt;" />
