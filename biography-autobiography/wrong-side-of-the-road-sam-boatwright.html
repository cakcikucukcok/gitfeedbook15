  <title>Wrong Side of the Road - Sam Boatwright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam Boatwright is an ordinary bloke. He does have limitations. The difference between him and everyone else? He doesn’t seem to have found his limitations - yet.  In 2012, Sam ran around the whole of the UK, battling through 50 miles each day for 50 days in a row. This was unbelievable, however, over this past summer Sam pushed his body even further by completing the seemingly impossible ‘Epic Adventure’. Sam cycled and ran from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States of America in 32 days. ‘Wrong Side of the Road’ tells the heartfelt and gruelling tale of the fallout after the ‘Epic Run’ and the subsequent awe-inspiring achievement of spanning the US completely self-propelled. If you are searching for the answer to the question – “How?” – this book is the answer." />
