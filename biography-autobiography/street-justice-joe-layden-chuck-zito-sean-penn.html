  <title>Street Justice - Joe Layden, Chuck Zito, Sean Penn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the streets of Brooklyn to the set of Oz.  From Hells Angel to celebrity bodyguard.  The revealing autobiography of an American man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuck Zito comes by his reputation honestly as one of the toughest, most uncompromising men ever to sit astride a Harley.  Now, with tales both hilarious and chilling, violent and truthful, Zito tells his life story in his own words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From growing up on the mean streets of Brooklyn and the Bronx, where fighting was a way of life, to becoming president of the New York chapter of the Hells Angels, to the wild and crazy life of protecting some of the world&#39;s biggest celebrities, Zito might be seen as a latter-day outlaw, the last of a dying breed of men.  But throughout his tempestuous days, one thing defined him: his unfailing sense of justice, of what&#39;s really right and what&#39;s really wrong.  That&#39;s how Zito found himself facing his biggest challenge: refusing to cooperate with a federal investigation into his brothers, the Hells Angels, and in the process losing the very thing he cherished most-his freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zito&#39;s astonishing recovery from this experience, and the unique kind of stardom he forged based on hard work and sheer will, is a testament to his courage, his ambition, and his indomitable heart-a testament now recorded unflinchingly in Street Justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
