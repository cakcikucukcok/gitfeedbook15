  <title>Once an Adult, Twice a Child - Brenda Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is dedicated to all of the families who have ever lost a loved one to Alzheimers and Dementia, I have spent over Twenty five years, giving care to these moms and dads, who have acquired this horrible disease . Id like to take you on my journey, and tell you about some of the experiences Ive dealt with, and some of the care Ive done, although some of these days, and nights were hard,   and sometimes I felt like running, not to return, I hung in there because I truly felt that this is my calling in life. There were a lot of tears, fears, smiles and laughter, and no matter how sad, or how hard times got, we could always find a moment for love. I hope that you will embrace my story, and find some comfort as you read about all of the challenges I encountered, while giving care to those who could not care for themselves. May you find a little laughter, as I take you through what some of you may view as impossible to go through. But unless you truly have a heart to give this type of care, it could never be for you, it can be greatly overwhelming. But for me, it is therapy, truly therapy. And this is why there are folks like me, it is my passion, I love to care for others. I hope you enjoy, and find some comfort, smiles, and a little laughter, as you go through this journey with me. I do not wish to be disrespectful, nor offend anyone by writing these short stories of actual accounts that happened with some of the people I cared for.  Im writing in hopes of you receiving some in site on what it takes to be a great caregiver, or find one. God bless." />
