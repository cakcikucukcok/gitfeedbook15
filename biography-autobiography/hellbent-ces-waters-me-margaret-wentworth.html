  <title>Hellbent: Ces Waters &amp; Me - Margaret Wentworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Waters family amazed and inspired their neighbour Margaret Wentworth. She&#39;d never met a man with bigger dreams than Ces, the charismatic father, nor one from such unpromising beginnings.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He&#39;d bashed, thieved and pimped in Manchester slums, did time and migrated to Australia. There he planned an assault on some of the world of sport&#39;s most glittering prizes. Sons Dean, Guy and Troy rose to dizzying heights. Troy came close to a world title in a San Diego boxing ring. On results, Ces Waters ranks among Australia&#39;s greatest trainers and motivators.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They saved doomed dogs, made winning horses out of old nags, ate no meat, drank no alcohol, never swore and focused single-mindedly on reaching the top.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She co-produced a documentary, &#39;Rebels with a Cause&#39;, about him, and began a biography, the basis for this book.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Ces&#39; rival was murdered, Margaret realise the man she was writing about was a lie. To silence her, Ces threatened the biographer&#39;s life. She was trapped. His laughter, jokes, yarns and &#39;honesty&#39; hid his sick obsessiveness and psychopathic ruthlessness. This manipulator operated at a level your office control freak only dreams of.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;Hellbent&#39; is a radical biography which shows how Ces used truth and lies to gain the author&#39;s trust and cloud her eyes, and how she began to see again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why was Ces Waters compared to Charles Manson in court?&lt;br /&gt;Why did he threaten his biographer&#39;s life?&lt;br /&gt;How did his three sons rise so high in boxing?&lt;br /&gt;Why was Allen Hall shot dead one night?&lt;br /&gt;Why was Dean Waters acquitted?&lt;br /&gt;Was Ces Waters a pimp?&lt;br /&gt;Was the Waters clan&#39;s clean living a total fraud?&lt;br /&gt;How did Ces Waters exercise the steely control he did?" />
