  <title>Hollywood Godfather - Gianni Russo, Patrick Picciarelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hollywood Godfather&lt;/i&gt; is Gianni Russo&#39;s over-the-top memoir of a real-life mobster-turned-actor who helped make &lt;i&gt;The Godfather &lt;/i&gt;a reality, and his story of life on the edge between danger and glamour.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gianni Russo was a handsome 25-year-old mobster with no acting experience when he walked onto the set of &lt;i&gt;The Godfather&lt;/i&gt; and entered Hollywood history. He played Carlo Rizzi, the husband of Connie Corleone, who set her brother Sonny--played by James Caan--up for a hit. Russo didn&#39;t have to act--he knew the mob inside and out: from his childhood in Little Italy, where Mafia legend Frank Costello took him under his wing, to acting as a messenger for New Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello during the Kennedy assassination, to having to go on the lam after shooting and killing a member of the Colombian drug cartel in his Vegas club.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along the way, Russo befriended Frank Sinatra, who became his son&#39;s godfather, and Marlon Brando, who mentored his career as an actor after trying to get Francis Ford Coppola to fire him from &lt;i&gt;The Godfather&lt;/i&gt;. Russo had passionate affairs with Marilyn Monroe, Liza Minelli, and scores of other celebrities.  He went on to become a producer and starred in &lt;i&gt;The Godfather: Parts I &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;II&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Seabiscuit, Any Given Sunday&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rush Hour 2,&lt;/i&gt; among many other films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hollywood Godfather&lt;/i&gt; is a no-holds-barred account of a life filled with violence, glamour, sex--and fun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
