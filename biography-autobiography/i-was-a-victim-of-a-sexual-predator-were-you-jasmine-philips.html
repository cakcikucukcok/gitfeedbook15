  <title>I Was a Victim of a Sexual Predator...Were You? - Jasmine Philips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Looking back, I cannot believe I allowed myself to be taken in, manipulated and mentally abused for 5 years by a man who never once told me he loved me.  How could an intelligent, well educated, mature woman with so much going for herself become a victim of a Sexual Predator?  Even now, I can&#39;t answer that question.  Those in the field of medicine, those who study the mind, may be able to help me answer that question.  For now, I just pray that it doesn&#39;t happen to you.  Don&#39;t let a handsome face and a few compliments cause you to lose everything in your life that is important.  I had everything I needed and I almost lost it all.  There are so many lonely women out here.  There are predators around every corner waiting for the opportunity to give you a compliment, get into your head, steal your heart, rape your body and rob you blind.  It happened to me and it could happen to you.   How many times have we heard and read stories of women in abusive relationships continuing to stay with the abuser or leaving and going back time and time again.  I would often ask myself how in the world could a woman go through that kind of abuse and not walk away.  Now that I have been in their shoes, I will never judge them again.  Something happens to you when you love someone.  Something breaks down in you and you can&#39;t see your way out.  Your self esteem becomes so damaged you become crippled.  The most important thing we can ever do for ourselves in this life is to love God and to love ourselves first and foremost.  If we do not know how to love ourselves, we will never know how to truly love someone else." />
