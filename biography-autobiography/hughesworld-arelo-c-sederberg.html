  <title>Hughesworld - Arelo C. Sederberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hughesworld&lt;/i&gt; is an authentic account written by a press spokesman for Howard Hughes that traces the highlights of his varied life in motion pictures and aviation but concentrates on the management struggle that followed his death in 1976.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hughes died intestate, or without a valid will, opening up a circus of phony will documents. In addition hundreds of far-distant relatives staked claims. A first cousin, Texas lawyer William Lummis, assumed control after a long and bitter struggle with executives and lawyers who had previously managed Hughes  businesses.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hughes is shown as a brilliant aviation pioneer and aircraft designer, as well as a motion picture producer and an able if unorthodox industrialist. At one time he owed a major airline, TWA, a leading oil well drilling bit company, Hughes Tool, and a missile and electonics concern, Hughes Aircraft. In the final phase of his business life, he owned six Las Vegas hotel-casinos.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;He ended as a tragic character, living secluded in pain from injuries sustained in plane crashes, rendered helpless by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
