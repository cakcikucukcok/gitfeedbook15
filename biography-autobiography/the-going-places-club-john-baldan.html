  <title>The Going Places Club - John Baldan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Going Places Club&lt;/em&gt; is a collaborative memoir of childhood and adolescence.&amp;nbsp; During the 1970s and early 1980s, the author and his best friend grew up in the town of Madison, New Jersey, fifteen miles west of Manhattan as the crow flies.&amp;nbsp; Although not a large or particularly famous place, Madison is a quintessentially suburban town; readers will recognize its salient features if they grew up in suburbia during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author&amp;rsquo;s friend, Jeff, possessed a spirit of observation and a sensibility beyond the typical childhood sensitivity to his surroundings.&amp;nbsp; These qualities allowed him to see his hometown in a unique way, as an artist might, by standing outside it and observing it dispassionately. &amp;nbsp;The detail of the prose is remarkable, practically pointillist.&amp;nbsp; Jeff&amp;rsquo;s vivid descriptions enabled John, this book&amp;rsquo;s author, to see his hometown in a way that he never could have on his own:&amp;nbsp;in stereo, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, the two boyhood friends decided to relate Jeff&amp;#39;s coming of age.&amp;nbsp; Jeff opened his prodigious memory bank, telling stories of family, friends, and other neighborhood characters, sending them to John.&amp;nbsp; John ordered and polished the&amp;nbsp;accounts, appending&amp;nbsp;some reminiscences of his own, and made the narrative thread more prominent.&amp;nbsp; The memoir is thus Jeff&amp;rsquo;s story as refracted through John&amp;rsquo;s sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coming-of-age memoir chronicles a friendship that has stood the test of time and of a world that has not, save in memory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
