  <title>Raising the Bar - Tim Rosaforte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open, the PGA Championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Career Grand Slam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could very well be the greatest golfer to ever play the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Raising the Bar&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how Tiger Woods changed his life, his game, and the way America views golf. There have been many biographies written about Tiger&#39;s life and early days with the PGA, but each ends with his triumphant victory in the 1997 Masters Championship. In the last few years Tiger has endured a lifetime of experiences, including his growing pains, his perceived slump in 1998, his incredible winning streak from 1999-2000, culminating in his career grand slam. Critically acclaimed golf writer and commentator Tim Rosaforte has watched Tiger since he burst onto the golfing scene and been an up-close observer of the Tiger&#39;s life both on and off the course. Totally revised and updated, &lt;i&gt;Raising the Bar&lt;/i&gt; includes Tiger&#39;s latest victories--including his historic 2001 Masters victory that completed the Tiger slam--and provides intense insight into his amazing career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
