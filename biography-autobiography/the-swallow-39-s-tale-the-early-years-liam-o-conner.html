  <title>The Swallow&#39;s Tale – the Early Years - Liam O’Conner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story will take you on a rollercoaster ride of adventure and heartbreak, desperation and eventual success but always with a deeper spiritual message as the common thread. This poignant and brutally honest memoir is set against a backdrop of laugh-until-you-cry humour and of emotion which touches the very core. 
It is a real against all odds story of the underdog, seemingly down and out for the count, face in the mud, battling for breath. But then the devilish Celtic warrior spirit rizes from the ashes as you get to glimpse into the eye of a man who has a fury in his heart and a desire to succeed no matter what is thrown at him. You get to travel from the streets of Cardiff to the sunny suburbs of Johannesburg in an enthralling story. 
At times it makes you smile with familiarity, on other occasions you are holding your sides with laughter. The sadder parts of the story are not to be read in public unless you have waterproof mascara or a potential excuse for hayfever. The story of Liam OConner is as varied as it is sensitive but underneath it all is still the little red haired boy, full of mischief and ambition. So if youre ready, get a cup of tea and a biscuit and go on a holiday of the mind. This is a must read." />
