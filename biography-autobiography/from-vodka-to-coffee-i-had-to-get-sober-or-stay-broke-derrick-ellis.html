  <title>From Vodka to Coffee: I Had to Get Sober or Stay Broke - Derrick Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In reading this book entitled from VODKA TO COFFEE &quot;I HAD TO GET SOBER OR STAY BROKE!&quot; The reader will venture with comedian Derrick Ellis as he goes from drinking heavy to not drinking at all. He will give you tips on how he got sober and how he managed to run a sober business. The book will also inspire one to go after your dreams. Mr. Ellis shows you in his third of a four book series, how alcohol almost bankrupted him and destroyed his dream of becoming a successful comedian and entrepreneur. The book will give you insight on changing your life situation and improving your self-esteem. This book will explore the whole notion of Patience. How patience is so important in life when pursuing ones goals. Also, how working hard pays off. Working hard is just part of having a successful life. You should have a vision and do not let anyone obstruct that vision. Also, when times are hard the book talks about moving forward as well as pushing the envelope in life. The book warns you about being aware of your surroundings and not letting people allow you to loose focus on your mission through negative comments and suggestions. This book is Mr. Ellis third book he has written. He wrote it for people around the world to read because it&#39;s an inspirational and motivational book with a taste of realization. I like to end by saying, after reading this book hopefully you will see how obstacles don&#39;t stop nothing when you are willing and focused on being successful in life. They are just a part of things you have to experience before becoming successful.&lt;U&gt; For more helpful books by Derrick Ellis log onto www.derrickellisbooks.com &quot;where reading is exciting!&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/U&gt;
