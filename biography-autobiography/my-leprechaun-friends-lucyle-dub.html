  <title>My Leprechaun Friends - Lucyle Dubé</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book intends to make you laugh and feel good. I dedicate it to everybody who believes in or who would like to believe that we live in a world full of magic and fantastic beings such as fairies, gnomes, dragons and leprechauns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child growing up, I knew deep inside that they were real and real they were because I believed. The visit of three leprechauns in my house was a real adventure. They lived with me for about fifteen years and they still occasionally visit me to make sure I am well and that I still believe in magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Marie Lucile Diane Dub and I am a SHAMAN. I was born in 1931 in a small town in Quebec by the name of Rivire-du-Loup (River of the Wolf ). I have Irish blood from my fathers side of the family and American Indian Sioux blood from my mothers side. I was raised in Montreal, and after divorcing at the age of 49, I went to live in Hawkesbury, Ontario. This is where everything in this book starts happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did the leprechauns come from? What were they doing in my house? Why were they living with my mother and me? What kinds of tricks they played on me, my mother and some of my friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain. Since their visit, my life has been full of magic and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
