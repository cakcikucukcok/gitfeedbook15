  <title>In the Light of God&#39;s Grace - Amy Nielsen, Lenny Grace Accosta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In the Light of Gods Grace is a short memoir and inspirational book for parents with special needs children, who seek answers to such questions as, What have we done wrong? and Why our child? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Its the story of one mother, Leny Grace Acosta, her husband, Christopher, and their only son, Ezekiel, who was born with quadriplegic cerebral palsy. Leny takes readers on her journey from pain to finding treatment for her sons disabilities, combining a medical and hands-on approach, common sense, and fervent prayers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lenys tender story includes how God placed her husband in her life, her near-death experience during childbirth that included an unforgettable vision of the light, her fathers encouraging words that brought her back, Be strong. Your son needs you, and the outpouring of support she received from her church.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Leny shares the sheer joy of her sons physical milestones, one step at a time, emphasizing his accomplishments more than his disabilities, and focusing on his cure rather than any disappointments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Armed with collective determination and spirit, Leny and Christopher are committed to never giving up, making sacrifices, and setting limitless goals in their quest to provide the best treatment for their fifteen-year old son.&lt;/P&gt;" />
