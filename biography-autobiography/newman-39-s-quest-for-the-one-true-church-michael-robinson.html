  <title>Newman&#39;s Quest for the One True Church - Michael Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cardinal Newman died on August 11, 1890 at the age
of 89.Although his mind remained lucid to
the end, his body declined to the point that in the summer of that
year it became evident to all that the end was near.
&lt;p&gt;However, on the evening of August 9 he staged a remarkable rally
which was recorded by Father William Neville, his secretary and
caregiver in his final years. Not recognizing his youthful step he was
surprised when Newman entered his room, and he was-unbent,
erect to the full height of his best days in the fifties; he was without
support of any kind. His whole carriage was, it may be said, soldierlike,
and so dignified; and his countenance was most attractive to
look at; even great age seemed to have gone from his face, and with
it all careworn signs; his very look conveyed the cheerfulness and
gratitude of his mind, and what he said was so kind, his voice was
quite fresh and strong, his whole appearance was that of power,
combined with complete calm... [Ward,The Life of Cardinal
Newman, vol.2,537]
&lt;p&gt;At his request he was buried in the grave of his friend Ambrose
St. John. On the memorial were engraved the words Ex umbris
et imaginibus in veritatem-from shadows and illusions into truth.
All of his life Newman had been a soldier for Christ-prepared to
do battle for the truth. This is the story of his spiritual journey;
emerging from the shadows into the fullness of truth." />
