  <title>Lumberjack Jesus: How to Develop Faith Despite Pitfalls, Roadblocks, Stupidity, and Prejudice - Bruce Kirkpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insightful and uplifting, &lt;em&gt;Lumberjack Jesus&lt;/em&gt; reminds us all that we need and deserve unconditional love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a series of essays written in memoir form, Bruce Kirkpatrick shows us a God who is loving, a good conversationalist, and often looks like a lumberjack. God comes alive in these pages in everyday life&amp;mdash;in stories about Vietnam heroes, cowboy movies, wrestling matches and chemistry sets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bruce Kirkpatrick discovered that as he was consumed by anger, shame and guilt&amp;mdash;quite literally dying on the inside&amp;mdash;Jesus came to him, looking like a lumberjack, in a red plaid shirt and a short-cropped beard. Even as he pushed Jesus far away and with such belligerence that reconciliation seemed impossible, Jesus was always there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bruce learned the love of Jesus is not just for caring Christians who never falter or fail at life. If Jesus can love and accept an uncaring, self-centered, lustful dope like Bruce, he can do the same for you. Nobody is beyond his reach or his hand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a unique and introspective style, these Christian Non-fiction stories will help you see faith in almost every circumstance in your life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book also contains unique prayers written by Bruce Kirkpatrick and hand-picked scripture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
