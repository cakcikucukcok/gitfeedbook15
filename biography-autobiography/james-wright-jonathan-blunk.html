  <title>James Wright - Jonathan Blunk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The authorized and sweeping biography of one of America&#39;s most complex, influential, and enduring poets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the extraordinary generation of American poets who came of age in the middle of the twentieth century, James Wright (1927-1980) was frequently placed at the top of the list. With a fierce, single-minded devotion to his work, Wright escaped the steel town of his Depression-era childhood in the Ohio valley to become a revered professor of English literature and a Pulitzer Prize winner. But his hometown remained at the heart of his work, and he courted a rough, enduring muse from his vivid memories of the Midwest. A full-throated lyricism and classical poise became his tools, honesty and unwavering compassion his trademark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using meticulous research, hundreds of interviews, and Wright&#39;s public readings, Jonathan Blunk&#39;s authorized biography explores the poet&#39;s life and work with exceptional candor, making full use of Wright&#39;s extensive unpublished work--letters, poems, translations, and personal journals. Focusing on the tensions that forced Wright&#39;s poetic breakthroughs and the relationships that plunged him to emotional depths, Blunk provides a spirited portrait, and a fascinating depiction of this turbulent period in American letters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gifted translator and mesmerizing reader, Wright appears throughout in all his complex and eloquent urgency. Discerning yet expansive, &lt;i&gt;James Wright&lt;/i&gt; will change the way the poet&#39;s work is understood and inspire a new appreciation for his enduring achievement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
