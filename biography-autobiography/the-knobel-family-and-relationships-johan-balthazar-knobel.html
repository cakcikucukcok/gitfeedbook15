  <title>The Knobel Family and Relationships - Johan Balthazar Knobel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book consolidates the information gathered by Johan Balthazar Knobel in the original book titled The Knobel Family and Relationships (published in 1894), and subsequent less formal documents made in 1895 and 1906, just before and just after the Boer War.  
The author stated on the cover of a copy of the book presented to a relative that he felt that the original work was: 
&quot;A labour of love, much spoiled by the printer &amp; by the copyist of type writing, 	
Pretoria 8 January 1896 
Whilst this publication attempts to remain as faithful to the original published work as possible, it does take into account his subsequent hand-written corrections, expansions, and explanations or translations where deemed appropriate to ease reading. The inconsistent or misprinted names and/or dates have been kept in the original work and are corrected at the back of the document in the section titled Photographs and Family Ties. Some inconsistencies are also explained in footnotes. The dates in the section Family Ties obviously only go until the cutoff date of 1906, as in the original.
We, the present family, are busy compiling a more detailed family list for future generations which will be available soon. We would appreciate any information from all the family members for this project." />
