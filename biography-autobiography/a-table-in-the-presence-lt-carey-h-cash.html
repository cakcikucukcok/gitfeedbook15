  <title>A Table in the Presence - Lt. Carey H. Cash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On April 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2003, the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Battalion, 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Marine Regiment, faced with the task of seizing the presidential palace in downtown Baghdad, ran headlong into what Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North called, &quot;the worst day of fighting for U.S. Marines.&quot; Hiding in buildings and mosques, wearing civilian clothes, and spread out for over a mile, Saddam Hussein&#39;s militants rained down bullets and rocket propelled grenades on the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Battalion. But when the smoke of the eight-hour battle cleared, only one Marine had lost his life. Some said the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Battalion was incredibly lucky. But in the hearts and minds of the Marines who were there, there was no question. God had brought them miraculously through that battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Battalion&#39;s chaplain, Lieutenant Carey Cash had the unique privilege of seeing firsthand, from the beginning of the war to the end, how God miraculously delivered, and even transformed, the lives of the men of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Battalion. Their regiment, the most highly decorated regiment in the history of the Marines, was the first ground force to cross the border into Iraq, the first to see one of their own killed in battle, and they were the unit to fight what most believe to have been the decisive battle of the war-April 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in downtown Baghdad. Through it all, Carey Cash says, the presence of God was undeniable. Cash even had the privilege of baptizing fifty-seven new Christians-Marines and Sailors-during the war in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The men of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Battalion came to discover what King David had discovered long ago--that God&#39;s presence could be richly experienced even in the presence of enemies. Here is the amazing story of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
