  <title>Big Mama&#39;s Little Black Jesus - William Roosevelt Leggette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many books have been written about the Southern lifestyle during the 1930&#39;s through the 1940&#39;s, but sit back and lend your ear (eyes) to a personal account of how a young man grew up under these trying conditions. Not only were the conditions trying, but getting an education was bleak and almost impossible, not just due to the segregation, but from the internal conflicts among the families. See how the hand of God moved to help this family over-come hardships and calamities, but how He touched the life of this young man when he was determined to better himself, his sisters and brothers, mother and father and to make a life outside the Racial Southern expectations of young black men. 
These are issues that I experienced growing up as a black person in the South in the USA. I want my children and grandchildren to know the things I experienced and how I was able to overcome and make a better life for my family. 
Currently I am living in Southern California, and I have lived quite a long life. I am currently on the downside of being a septagenarian. Unfortunately, I have lost my eyesight due to a disease called diabetic retinopathy. I am dependent on my wife and my sister to assist me in getting this book completed. I have been trying to get the book finished for the past fifteen years. I hope this book gives insight to not only my family, but to all that would care to read it." />
