  <title>The Way of Being Lost - Victoria Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;After a tumultuous period of crisis, Victoria Price rebuilt her life by embracing a daily practice of joy, healing childhood wounds and reconnecting to the example set by her father Vincent, the famed actor. Her journey involved stepping away from externalities and into her father&#39;s legacy &amp;#8212; his love for people and compassion for others, his generosity of spirit and simple kindnesses, his enthusiasm for new experiences, and his love of life. &lt;BR&gt;&quot;As I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;ve come to understand that every day, in everything we do, we have a choice &amp;#8212; between expanding into our lives or contracting into our fears, into saying Yes! to life &amp;#8230; or saying No,&quot; Victoria observes. This intimate and inspiring book shares the lessons learned from a powerful family heritage of remaining curious, giving back, and saying Yes. Join her as she shares the stories, experiences, and lessons that led her back to her truest self,&amp;nbsp;including her lifesaving daily practice of joy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;A brilliant account of finding and following one&#39;s inner light by a true pioneer that will help every reader do the same.&quot; &amp;#8212; Mike Dooley, &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author of &lt;I&gt;Infinite Possibilities&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Notes from the Universe&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&quot;In &lt;I&gt;The Way of Being Lost&lt;/I&gt;, Victoria does what all of us wish to do &amp;#8212; seek out her own relationship with spirituality and make the sacred a part of her everyday life, merely by observing the world around us in all its glory. Her writing shows the struggles of this way of being, but also its rewards.&quot; &amp;#8212; Miranda McPherson, author of &lt;I&gt;Meditations on Boundless Love &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Too often we think that to lead a spiritual life requires doing everything right. That is not just a tall order, it is an erroneous one. Spirituality is about a quest for a home in love, which we will find when we finally listen to the call of our truest selves. As Victoria Price knows, this journey may come later than we hoped, but it bears the fruit of our life experience, and takes its own time to ripen. This beautiful recounting of Victoria&#39;s voyage shows us a path for discovering the Third Way and living it fully.&quot; &amp;#8212; Fr. Richard Rohr, Founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;In her inspiring memoir &lt;I&gt;The Way of Being Lost&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Victoria Price walks us all back home.

Though it takes great courage to make this trip, the rewards are beyond measure. And in the case of &lt;I&gt;The Way of Being Lost&lt;/I&gt;, the journey is beautifully told, universally relevant, and deeply meaningful.&quot; &amp;#8212; Christiane Northrup, M.D., &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author of &lt;I&gt;Goddesses Never Age&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Victoria Price&#39;s journey is a truly inspiring one. She looks both outward and inward to find joy all around her. She has been a close friend to me for years and I have always been moved by her story and thrilled that she is finally sharing it with the world.&quot; &amp;#8212; Melissa Etheridge, Grammy&amp;#174;- and Oscar&amp;#174;-winning musician and activist&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Victoria Price is a fighter &amp;#8212; for her belief in a world that is connected by Love, and for her own connection to Joy.
