  <title>To All Survivors - Yakov Avidon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Before that morning, I had only heard of prisons. After all, these had nothing
to do with my life. But now, bewildered and numb, I was standing in a small
hot room trying to keep from falling down, author Yakov Avidon describes
as he opens To All Survivors, an intense, gripping, and graphic memoir of
himself-a man who was there.
He didnt seem to remember much. All he knew was that he was in some
kind of prison with many beds, in blocks of eight, all welded together. Trying
to remember, he looks back at the circumstances leading him to his present
dilemma, beginning with his childhood and family. Jewish, he recalls fleeing
from his home, when Germany invaded the country. He mentions the painful
and bloody encounters, as well as many other heartbreaking and enduring
exploits he and his family had to undergo while trying to stay alive. How
the events unfold towards the narrators eventual redemption will touch the
readers hearts.
Not only an autobiography, To All Survivors also revisits a painful part of
history-pre and post Soviet Union, through the authors memories. Avidon
shares his story in this compelling read in an effort to share what actually
happened in the past, to settle with it once and for all, and to serve as an
inspiration for others. For more information on this book, interested parties
