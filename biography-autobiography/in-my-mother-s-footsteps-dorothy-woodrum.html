  <title>In My Mother’S Footsteps - Dorothy Woodrum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the age of twenty-one, Dorothy Woodrum decided to follow her mothers footsteps and become a nurse. She graduated from Connecticuts Hartford Hospital Nursing School in 1961, the same place where her mother had received her training. At that monumental moment, when her mother put Dorothys nurses cap on her for the first time, Dorothy experienced one of the proudest parts of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented in Dorothys own words, In My Mothers Footsteps tells an inspiring story of a lifetime of giving. She traces her early childhood and adolescence growing up in Connecticut and shares how her mothers love and generosity, which influenced her to pursue a career in nursing. After nursing school, Dorothy juggled family responsibilities with her job, yet continued her mothers legacy of lovingly caring for the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was when Dorothy began to work with hospice patients that she found her true calling. She was able to use her deep, abiding faith in God to help families and patients make the difficult transition from life to death. For the past thirty-six years, she has experienced overwhelming fulfillment in a career she was meant to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartwarming and memorable, In My Mothers Footsteps shares the beauty of one womans benevolent human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
