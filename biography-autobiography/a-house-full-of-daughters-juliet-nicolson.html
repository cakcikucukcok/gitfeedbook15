  <title>A House Full of Daughters - Juliet Nicolson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A family memoir that traces the myths, legends, and secrets of seven generations of remarkable women&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All families have their myths and legends. For many years Juliet Nicolson accepted hers--the dangerous beauty of her flamenco dancing great-great-grandmother Pepita, the flirty manipulation of her great-grandmother Victoria, the infamous eccentricity of her grandmother Vita Sackville-West, her mother&#39;s Tory-conventional background. But then Juliet, a distinguished historian, started to question. As she did so, she sifted fact from fiction, uncovering details and secrets long held just out of sight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A House Full of Daughters&lt;/i&gt; takes us through seven generations of women. In the nineteenth-century slums of Malaga, the salons of fin-de-siecle Washington D.C., an English boarding school during the Second World War, Chelsea in the 1960s, the knife-edge that was New York City in the 1980s, these women emerge for Juliet as people in their own right, but also as part of who she is and where she has come from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A House Full of Daughters &lt;/i&gt;is one woman&#39;s investigation into the nature of family, memory, and the past. As Juliet finds uncomfortable patterns reflected in these distant and more recent versions of herself, she realizes her challenge is to embrace the good and reject the hazards that have trapped past generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
