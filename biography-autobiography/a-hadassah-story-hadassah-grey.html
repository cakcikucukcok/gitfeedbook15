  <title>A Hadassah Story - Hadassah Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Choice is a tricky proposal, and every choice, good or bad, has its consequences. In &lt;i&gt;A Hadassah Story&lt;/i&gt;, author Hadassah Grey shares both the choices shes made in her life and the results of those choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with her birth in Akers, South Carolina, in 1951, Grey narrates her storyher childhood and teen years, her marriage at seventeen, her separation and divorce, another relationship and the birth of a second child, her drug and alcohol use, and the pain of the separation from her children. She tells of trying to get her life on track, knowing she needed the help of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Hadassah Story&lt;/i&gt;, Grey shows how she, a beautiful young woman from a small country town raised in a loving, yet sheltered environment, survived the harsh and heartless lifestyle of the big city. She shares how God divinely orchestrated her steps to achieve his divine plan for her life. This story of strength and faith confirms the saying that all things work together for the good of those who love God are called according to his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
