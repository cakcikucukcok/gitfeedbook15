  <title>My Country, My Life - Ehud Barak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER OF THE 2018 NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive memoir of one of Israel&#39;s most influential soldier-statesmen and one-time Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, with insights into forging peace in the Middle East.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2000, the most decorated soldier in Israel&#39;s history--Ehud Barak--set himself a challenge as daunting as any he had faced on the battlefield: to secure a final peace with the Palestinians. He would propose two states for two peoples, with a shared capital in Jerusalem. He knew the risks of failure. But he also knew the risks of &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; trying: letting slip perhaps the last chance for a generation to secure genuine peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a moment of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of many in a life intertwined, from the start, with that of Israel. Born on a kibbutz, Barak became commander of Israel&#39;s elite special forces, then army Chief of Staff, and ultimately, Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Country, My Life&lt;/i&gt; tells the unvarnished story of his--and his country&#39;s--first seven decades; of its major successes, but also its setbacks and misjudgments. He offers candid assessments of his fellow Israeli politicians, of the American administrations with which he worked, and of himself. Drawing on his experiences as a military and political leader, he sounds a powerful warning: Israel is at a crossroads, threatened by events beyond its borders and by divisions within. The two-state solution is more urgent than ever, not just for the Palestinians, but for the existential interests of Israel itself. Only by rediscovering the twin pillars on which it was built--military strength &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;moral purpose--can Israel thrive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
