  <title>Lyrics and How They Inspire Me - Nathan Catchpole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For as long as author Nathan Catchpole could remember, he
has always loved music. In fact, he loved it so much that he
started writing lyrics when he was just twelve years old. He has
written over a thousand songs since then. In his book, he reveals
Lyrics and How They Inspire Me.
He first heard music when he was only three years old, although
he couldnt understand what the singers were singing about. He
only knew that he liked what he was hearing and years later,
music would become a central part of his life. In Lyrics and How
They Inspire Me, Catchpole shares his favorite singers and the
songs that inspired him. He gives brief biographies of each along
with their discographies and points out the particular lyrics that
moved him to create his own.
An entertaining at the same time informative book, Lyrics and
How They Inspire Me provides readers insight on singers lives,
their hits and misses, and the impact they had on their fans." />
