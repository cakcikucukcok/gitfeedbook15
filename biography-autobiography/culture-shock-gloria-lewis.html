  <title>Culture Shock - Gloria Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The scene is set in the Caribbean, where a young woman of humble upbringing has caught the eye of an American Young Man, who ignited her imagination with stories of American Dreams.  This wasnt the first time she had heard wonderful stories about America; she had seen the American TV Shows and heard those wonderful stories throughout her entire young life. Like most everyone on the small island of Barbados, at that time, she had learned to admire America; so when this young man offered her a life of Milk and Honey, full of excitement and wonder, in a new world, where all of her dreams could come true; it was easy to say yes. 
The book goes on to tell a story of how a young, nave girl, was suddenly forced into Woman-hood and how she was forced to face the truth about humanity and forced to confront the realities of her life in the United States vs. the romantic dreams of her childhood. The lessons she learned, shed light on her youth, as well as the contradictions and ironies of life on a tiny and humble island in the Caribbean vs. her life in a big, powerful and proud Super Power of a nation. Was moving to America the correct decision? Will she prosper and realize the American Dream? Is the life she has found in the United States better than the life she abandoned in Barbados? Does the romance pan out? Does this dashing, young Prince Charming on the shiny white horse turn out to be her Night in Shining Armor? And now that so many years have passed, what lessons has she learned? What wisdom does she have to share?
 Get ready for a trip to the Amusement Park Prepare for the greatest little side show youve ever witnessed. Get ready for a walk through the Fun House, where you will gaze into a mirror and take a look at yourself, but the reflection you see will be distorted, compared to the one you are accustomed to. You are about to take the emotional rollercoaster ride of a life time! Dont be afraid; because throughout all of the emotional ups and downs, you will feel the strength, the faith and the determination. You will know that failure is not an option! You will witness the lessons learned and eventually, the solutions will become clear and you will see hope on the horizon and inspiration will rise, like the sun rises to bring warmth to a cold world!" />
