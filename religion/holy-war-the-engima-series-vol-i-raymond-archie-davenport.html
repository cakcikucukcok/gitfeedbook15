Humanity is in danger and I would like to go into deeper detail on how and why I have come to the conclusion that mankind threatened. This book or series will expose the danger, lies and deceit that kept me and still a lot of other people in a trance for so long. This book will explain the real definition of Holy War, why the world as we know it is called and considered The Matrix and how that translates to The System. And this new truth that I have discovered, I would like to share with the rest of any and everyone who is like me tired of living in fear and the nonsense and find some peace in knowing the truth." />
