  <title>The Mystery of Code 137 - Martin Le</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Although written fiction, it&amp;#39;s facts are base on our reality. It very well could have been written non-fiction for that matter, just a fact the reader should know. Its mystery is base on metaphorical templates that explains why our world history since 1492 (Discovery of the New World) rhymes with that of Exodus from the Old Testament. It starts with &amp;ldquo;Abraham&amp;#39;s calling&amp;rdquo; and ends with a promise deliverance all the same, as it was in Egypt. Our experience of space and time operates like a matrix, a trigger of a specific calling, on a very important date and cause, could take effect. For example, they begin at 1492 the discovery of the New World, or 1776 the Declaration of Independence. The mystery takes us through our world history and explains how we have been going through our own &amp;ldquo;Egypt.&amp;rdquo; It is the basis behind why Genesis is a story of creation and it takes us through the mind of God, for he works all things in his natural law. All that we have experience from the Protestant Reformation, the creation of Great Britain, WWI, WWII, the 1929 Crash, Pearl Harbor, 9/11, the economic calamities of 1929 and the recent Subprime Financial Crisis are all metaphorical templates that expressed the stories of Genesis in metaphor and exact analogies to how they how played out four generations from Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and finally Moses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example or event here, is Jacob&amp;#39;s &amp;ldquo;20-Year bondage&amp;rdquo; that you will see from Genesis 31:41 (Jacob speaking to Laban)-&amp;ldquo;Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle. This here can explain in metaphors the Proclamation of 1763 to the end of the American Revolution in 1783, 20-years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
