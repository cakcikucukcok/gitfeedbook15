  <title>Pain in the Church - Rev. John D. Housewright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pain in the Church is a straight forward overview of the Heavenly Father living with mankind through the blood atonement of Jesus.  As the Holy Spirit teaches we can find many things hindering the whole working together yet there is victory within the church as we learn these lessons.  Suffering the pain and overcoming all obstacals we do not have to throw away any soul that wants to serve Jesus with a true heart.  It shows that if we refuse to deal with this pain the sores just get worse until division and separation occures.  Following the examples laid out before us we can admit it, quit it and move on loving Jesus and each other.  This book reveals awesome insights to inspire any one hurt by the church to defeat the wrong, self and outside influences.  What is purposed within these pages will let us see there is not a perfect church but there should always be peace, hope and happiness inside.  We can enjoy our time in this journey with Jesus and love the life we have.  After all Pain in the Church should never be acceptable!
When most people see a book like this they seldom recognize it&#39;s true value.  There is so much information within these pages that all questions you would have about a relationship with God should be answered.  You can find Jesus here and learn how not to spend so much of your time hurting others.  Learn to please Him and you will fullfill all the comandments.  May God bless!" />
