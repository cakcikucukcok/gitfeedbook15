  <title>The Scandal of God&#39;s Forgiveness - Edmond Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do we appreciate to the full why the Jewish believers of the early church &quot;were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on Gentiles&quot;? Why they were amazed that &quot;God had granted repentance&quot; to Gentiles for eternal life?  Sacred history is to be seen through enlightened Jewish eyes, revealing that Israel was initially the sole beneficiary of God&#39;s revelation before Christ. For the most part the Gentiles were &quot;allowed . . . to walk in their own ways.&quot; Such was according to divine predestination and the prerogative that God has the freedom to be merciful on whom he desires to be merciful. At the coming of Christ--to the surprise of Jewish believers--Gentiles in numbers became subjects of God&#39;s electing love as well. Jesus died for &quot;the world&quot; in the sense that he died for Jew and Gentile.  And God&#39;s freedom in predestination continues to be manifested in the election of both Jew and Gentile, with Christ dying specifically for all those elected of God, as a wide survey of New Testament texts verify." />
