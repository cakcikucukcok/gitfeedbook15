  <title>Subway Music - Reynold Joseph Paul Junker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Subway Music&lt;/I&gt; is about finding things Reynold Junker thought he had lost forever: his subway music and his name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Subway Music&lt;/I&gt; begins in a Manhattan hotel room the day after he and his wife celebrated their Christmas anniversary. She coaxes him into taking her to Brooklyn to see where &quot;all those stories you tell all of the time about growing up&quot; took place. As a certified Californian, that&#39;s the last thing he wants to do. Subways were then. Freeways are now. But they go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At Prospect Park he &quot;finds&quot; his father and learns about both courage and reverse prejudice-prejudice against his &quot;Nazi&quot; father. At Coney Island he remembers his Jewish best friend and futile attempts to convert him to Catholicism using the holy waters of Coney Island to turn him into a Jewish Cary Grant. At Kings Highway he visits the house haunted by his old ghosts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At the end of &lt;I&gt;Subway Music&lt;/I&gt; he realizes that subway music and Brooklyn will always be as much a part of him as the color of his eyes or the color of his hair. Being from Brooklyn was his fate. Being a Californian is just the way things sometimes work out." />
