  <title>90 at 90 - Kenneth J. Dale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ken Dale has lived for 90 years as a modern man, and therefore as one who deeply respects the thinking of scientists who limit the world they study to what is objective.  Unfortunately, some moderns tell us we should all follow suit.  Yet science has no plausible account of the subjective experience of scientists or of any of us.  Dale refuses to ignore what he knows best, his own experience, and when one clearly affirms the subjective realm at any point, all sorts of questions open up.  He is quite confident that in this realm he has met God, and he encourages us to think with him about what that means.  There is no better way to examine ones own experience and come to ones own judgments than to engage the wisdom of another seeker like Dale.  He offers us his insights freely and forthrightly in brief meditations on questions that concern us all. Plunge in!
