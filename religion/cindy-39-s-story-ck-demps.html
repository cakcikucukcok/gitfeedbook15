  <title>Cindy&#39;s Story - Ck Demps</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Summary
	This book was written with the hope it will touch and help someone that has gone through and struggled with similar situations.  Whether you have gone through them personally or know someone who has, this book should give you an inside view of the feelings of hurt and betrayal.  This is a story that covers everything from growing up with parents that abused drugs to being a single mother/parent in my adult life.  It is the memories of a small child growing up in a home filled with chaos, along with feeling scared and alone.  From start to finish I have had issues to deal with like losing someone to suicide at a young age to being homeless after graduation.  I hope this book is encouraging to you no matter what has happened in your life.  I will try and give some advice that has helped me cope along with comfort and direction to guide you to the right path.  I hope I can help many of you, but if I reach out to just one, then this book is a success.  From childhood to my adult life, I have dealt with a lot of circumstances.  You Are Not Alone!
I want to share my life with you and help you through tough times." />
