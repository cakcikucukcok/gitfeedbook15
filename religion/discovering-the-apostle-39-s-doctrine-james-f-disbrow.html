  <title>Discovering the Apostle&#39;s Doctrine - James F. Disbrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Discovering the Apostles Doctrine is sure to inflame the Christian community and will be considered a very controversial read by those who study Gods word with an inflexible understanding of Christian theology.  Once the pages of this book and the minds of the readers are opened the comments of the author intertwined with biblical truth of scripture will bring a new enlightenment and a deeper understanding of Gods will.  In Christendom over the last 2 millenniums there has been a departure from the true gospel of Jesus Christ as was presented by his apostles.  In fact, the doctrines that were expressly taught by the apostles of Jesus Christ and that are presented in the New Testament are for the most part not followed by Christendom today.  This book will bring the readers attention to the many warnings, which God has given mankind through his prophets, the apostles and His son Jesus Christ.  These warnings were given that mankind then and now might be made aware that there exists in the world false prophets, wolves in sheeps clothing, false Christs, traditions of men and doctrines of devils with one purpose, to destroy mans hope of any relationship with God!  In the spirit of the Watchman on the Wall it has been the writers effort to not only warn the reader but to give biblical direction to the saving grace that is found in Jesus Christ alone.  This book will be the cause of much debate and will be considered heretical in many corners of Christendom.  However, a closer look at the scriptures and with the help of the authors comments the reader will uncover the fundamental truths of God and embrace the eternal hope that is in Jesus Christ.  Jesus tells us that it is the broad way that will lead humanity to destruction and unfortunately many people will follow that path.  Broadway is known for its bright lights, its glamour, excitement and its many opportunities to indulgence ones self.  The broad way is also the way of deception, distraction, discouragement, distruction and death.  Jesus further explained that the road or pathway to eternal life is a narrow passage and few people will find it.  It is the writers prayer that this book will provoke the reader to study their bible with a receptive mind comparing scripture with scripture.  Jesus died for everyone of us but the bible tells us that heaven itself is not for everyone.  Revelation 21:27 states that there shall in no wise enter into the city of God any thing that defiles, neither those who have an abdominal life style or those who are filled with deception (liars), however those who have believed the truth of the scriptures will have found eternal life and their new home.  A person must be born in to the family of God through faith in Jesus Christ.  The apostles of Jesus have given us the road map to eternal life through their writings found in Gods word.  Discovering the Apostles Doctrine will reassure the reader that Jesus is the way, the truth and the life!  Every professing Christian and every soul looking for Gods truth needs to read this book with their Bible at least once!  This book is not fiction and it is not meant to be read for entertainment.  This book is a sincere look into the word of God as it was brought to humanity by Gods prophets and the apostles of Jesus.  This book is meant to help the reader think, pray and secure their eternal salvation!" />
