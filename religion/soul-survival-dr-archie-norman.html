  <title>Soul Survival - Dr. Archie Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do Christians espouse a promise of joy and peace while often leading a life full of unresolved problems, relational conflicts, and personal failures?  Christians have won the battle for their eternal destinies, but far too many times are losing the present conflict for soul prosperity.  This inner conflict is won by understanding how God has uniquely designed us as living souls and how He has equipped us with Biblical instructions, revealing that our problems are solved from the inside out.  
The failure to distinguish what has taken place our spirit and what has happened to our soul when we trust in Christ can lead to confusion and doubts about our relationship with God.  The subject of salvation must be examined in the context of the entire person, which includes spirit, soul, and body.  Just as we would not expect our bodies to be perfect the moment Christ comes into our lives, neither should we think that the soul is delivered from all the baggage we bring from our past.  Through the power of the word forgive, the Christian can deal with these past circumstances and begin the journey towards soul health. 
The trip to wellness on the inside will happen as the depository of the mind is renewed by truth and the heart discovers God&#39;s ultimate goal of love.  Unfortunately the one aspect of the soul which is unsalvageable is the flesh, which is determined to be the king of our will and leaves God as the only recourse for the healing of the soul.  Discover the Biblical GPS for guidance and direction to inner peace in Soul Survival." />
