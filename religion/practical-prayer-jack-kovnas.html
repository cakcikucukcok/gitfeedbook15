  <title>Practical Prayer - Jack Kovnas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do you know what Gods direction is for your life? How can you find and more clearly understand the wondrous plans &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt; has for you? Would you like to uncover the hidden passion thats lying in wait inside of you? 
&lt;p&gt;In any economygood or baddo you ever fret about bills and money? Do you experience troubling nagging stressful life issues? Have you been skeptical or had a careless attitude about whether dark, evil forces are real or not? Would you like to encounter a fresh and enlightening simplistic perspective concerning this issue and spiritual warfare?
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is an inspiring, modern-day true story of discovery that will give thought-provoking insight and answers to these and other important questions and problematic dilemmas. Author Jack Kovnas does not tell you how to pray as much as he shows you through his own teaching examples of actual prayer events.
&lt;p&gt;With deep humility, he candidly reveals how sinfully and shamefully he lived the beginning stages of his Christian lifewithout prayerbut then turned completely around as he uncovered genuine happiness &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; prayer.
&lt;p&gt;Inside this book you will find a declaration by somebody who learned the value of praying and trusting Godwho willingly gave up house and possessions, and then watched in amazement as they returned.
&lt;p&gt;This informative prayer-ride journey is a testimony to what God can and will do for any and all of us. As Jack humbly and assuredly attestseven though it is his own true life story, every sincere, caring word on each and every page is not about himit is about &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;!
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not upon thine own understanding.
In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Proverbs 3:5-6 (KJV)
