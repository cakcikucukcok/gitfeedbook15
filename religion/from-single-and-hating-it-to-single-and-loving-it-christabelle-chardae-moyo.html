  <title>From Single and Hating It to Single and Loving It - Christabelle Chardae Moyo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in a world where, when you get to a certain age, there is a lot of pressure to be in a relationship. Everyone asks, How can you be in your twenties and still be single? What is wrong with you? When are you going to get married? 
For years that was my story: a girl depressed at not being where other people expected her to be. A girl who wanted badly to be with someone, anyone, just so she could fit in with the world. 
This book is written to share that story with transparency and to encourage every single girl to know that you are not alone in this walk. Never be ashamed to share your struggles with the season of being single. Dont let the world define you or where you should be. Instead, learn who you were created to be. Learn how much you are worth. Learn to shut down the voices that dont matter. 
This book is about a journey to freedom: freedom from the worlds expectations, freedom from relationship expectations, and freedom to be the authentic version of yourself." />
