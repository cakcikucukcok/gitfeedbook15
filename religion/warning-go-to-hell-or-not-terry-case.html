  <title>Warning! Go to Hell! or Not? - Terry Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, guided by the Holy Spirit, was written to help you fully embrace Jesus, the Christ, as your Savior and your God. 
Christ means the anointed one. This book, along with Gods Word, is to help you gain a more complete knowledge, understanding, and application of the gospel in your life. This book is to help you gain a strong foundation for your life with God. Christians are to reach unbelievers and introduce them to Christ. My book is about understanding Gods Word to be a born-again believer (salvation).
It is for building a strong foundation in the believer that has been in the church. It is for new believers to help build a Christian foundation for fuller understanding to stay focused on our process of Christianity to salvation when we physically die. It is laying out the needed information in a more logical way to get to heaven. God tells you to study to show yourself approved to him. A lot of study is needed. God did not lay it all out in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 order. All need full understanding. All need spiritual maturity to enable full understanding. There is too much confusion in the church, and this will help. The next book will be bringing to light some of the confusion in the church. Gods Word is Gods Word and not always what you have been taught from too many different sources combined with wrong interpretation, leading to your output." />
