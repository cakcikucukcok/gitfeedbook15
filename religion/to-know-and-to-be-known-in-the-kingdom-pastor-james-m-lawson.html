  <title>To Know and to Be Known in the Kingdom - Pastor James M. Lawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;There are two major themes throughout the book. The first major theme involves the dual nature of the Kingdom being both here and now and yet to come, but with the focus being on the here and now aspect and learning to live everyday life in it. The second major theme involves knowing and being known in Christs Kingdom. Another significant focus is on &lt;U&gt;all&lt;/U&gt; relationships, starting with our personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and then all other relationships with all people in our daily lives. &lt;/P&gt;

This book is about Relationship-vs-Religion. This book is full of controversy as it actually faces and deals with real problems, issues, and lies instead of avoiding them. This book provides teaching on how to have better, stronger, and healthier relationships with all people from all walks of life. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;This book is very exciting because of its unique and aggressive attacks on institutionalized systems of religions and religious Churches and people. The approach and writing style is so Non-Traditional and Non-Religious that it stands alone, separate and unique, like no other Christian book has ever been written. This book reveals many secrets of the Kingdom, exposes many lies and false doctrines, and upholds the truth of Christ, His WORD, and His Kingdom, and supports the common people of the world.&lt;/P&gt;
