  <title>Wake Up—God’S Talking to You - Manny Dean Fernandez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of time, God has spoken to people in their dreams. Through them he has reached out to both men of GodIsaiah, Daniel, Jeremiah, Jacob, and his dream interpreter son, Josephand ungodly men and women, like Pharaoh or Pontius Pilates wife. Even today, God has not stopped speaking to us in our dreams. We simply stopped listening or being aware of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than twenty years ago, after God woke him up one night with an incredible dream, author Manny Fernandez set off on a lifelong journey to explore what could be learned from dreams. He made it his mission to teach others how to remember their dreams and, with Gods help, interpret their meaning. In his guidebook, Fernandez includes his own diary of dreams, associated Scriptures and explanations, ways to remember and understand Gods special messages, an examination of parables, and his ideas for connecting with God through dreams and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wake UpGods Talking to You&lt;/i&gt; is an innovative teaching tool that guides spiritual seekers through all the ways God speaks to us through dreams and brings us closer to Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
