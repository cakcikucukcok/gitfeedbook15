  <title>The Good News of the Kingdom  for a Modern World - Elaia Luchnia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nearly 2000 years ago, the Good News of the Kingdom began to be preached throughout the Mediterranean by a carpenters son, Jesus of Nazareth. His teachings restored dignity and religious freedom to all who heeded his message of hope. 
However, within 400 years, Christianity had lost its way and reverted back to the old ways of clergy/laity distinctions. Ecclesiastical authority brought divisions and sects, and pitted Christian against Christian. The individual disciple lost his spiritual autonomy and was relegated to a position of servitude to a church rather than as a dynamic free son of God. As a result, the Good News as Jesus conceived it has to a large extent been submerged under so much dogma. Christianity today languishes for lack of a new vision of Jesus life and the religion that he practiced. 
Modern man will refuse to accept a religion which is inconsistent with known facts and out of harmony with his highest conceptions of truth, beauty, and goodness. He will not acquiesce to a religion based on supers-titious bondage and religious fear. Therefore, what is needed is a new revelation of Jesus life illuminated with a new understanding of his Good News of eternal salvation. 
The purpose of this book is to reintroduce Jesus to mankind. The world needs new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings. Until then, worldwide harmony will continue to be the illusive dream of a hopeful minority instead of the tangible reality of a God-knowing human race. 
And when this Good News is preached in all the inhabited earth, the end of wickedness, sorrow, distress, and anguish will come. (Matthew 24:14)" />
