  <title>The Ultimate End - Jimmy D. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND BIBLICAL PROPHECY?  NOW YOU CAN.
There is an absolute Truth that everyone should know:  The world as we know it will come to an end, and it will be in the near future.  There is going to be a day of reckoning for our world.  God Almighty is going to judge the Earth and the entire universe and it will all be destroyed in an instant.  This is an absolute fact, whether you choose to believe it or not.
Within the pages of The Ultimate End, you will find a clear and concise explanation of the very synopsis of the end times written by the Apostle John in the Book of Revelation.
Here you can discover that The Revelation is not a book of vague mystery, but rather a writing of true revelation, which is intended to be understood by anyone who will trust and believe God&#39;s Word." />
