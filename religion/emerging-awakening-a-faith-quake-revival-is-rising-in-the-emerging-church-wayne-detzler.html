  <title>Emerging Awakening-A Faith Quake: Revival Is Rising in the Emerging Church - Wayne Detzler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The term emerging church causes confusion, conflict, and contention whenever it is used. Still, the emerging movement is spreading across America and around the world. Young adults from the millennial or mosaic generation are flocking back to church in droves, when the church speaks relevantly to them. The impact of emerging churches reaches far beyond the narrow walls of church buildings. The millennial generation is content with nothing less than a holy revolution in society. These eager young people purpose to transform the cities of America and the world through living the life of Jesus. Emerging believers are more concerned with life than with doctrine. They are committed to orthopraxy (true behavior) and not just dead orthodoxy. This propels them into situations foreign to most Christ followers. Their aim is a conquest of cities for Christ, and to that end they live out the Jesus life in every aspect of community. Authenticity is their watchword. They are resolved to be real in an unreal world. Members of the emerging churches keep each other honest before God, and they accept nothing less than committed Christian character. The result is a growing revival among the emerging churches." />
