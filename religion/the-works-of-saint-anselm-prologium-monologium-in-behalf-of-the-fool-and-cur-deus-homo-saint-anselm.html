  <title>The Works of Saint Anselm (Prologium, Monologium, In Behalf of the Fool, and Cur Deus Homo) - Saint Anselm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anselm of Canterbury, later canonized in the 1100&#39;s, was a Benedictine monk and philosopher who is known as the father of scholasticism. He is also the founder of the ontological argument, saying that God exists because of his infinite power and authority over mankind. His written works are known for their rationalization of faith based on spiritual truths found within the Christian belief, which is detailed in &quot;Proslogium.&quot; He believed in varying degrees of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad,&quot; which meant that there must be an ultimate goodness with which to compare &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot; For Saint Anselm in &quot;Monologium,&quot; this ultimate goodness is God. &quot;Why God Became Man&quot; discusses how Jesus Christ was sent to atone for God&#39;s dissatisfaction with mankind, defending God&#39;s honor and justice. Saint Anselm&#39;s ideas were not universally accepted. One rebuttal came in the form of &quot;In Behalf of the Fool,&quot; a response to and critique of Saint Anselm&#39;s works written by the Benedictine monk Gaunilo. Today, Saint Anselm&#39;s writings, as well as the critique by Gaunilo, remain critical to anyone studying Christian theology. Saint Anselm&#39;s rationalization based purely on intuitive reasoning is astonishing. Because Saint Anselm did not rely on empirical evidence for faith, his beliefs were truly a test of his personal faith in God. Saint Anselm and his works are both impressive testaments to the historic and social significance of the Christian religion." />
