Ninth and Last Sign: You will hear of a dwelling place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash.  It will appear as a blue star.  And very soon after this the ceremonies of people will cease.  There are nine signs that great destruction has come and is coming.  Like many tribes, the Hopis drew images that have come to pass and images of things to come.   &lt;p&gt;
Thirteen Baktuns is equal to just over 5,125 years, and in our present age of the jaguar, the fourth age, the Great Cycle runs out on the winter solstice, December 21, 2012, the Mayan end date.  The meaning is the death of the sun, the rebirth of a universe, and the Mayan Prophecy of the return of the god Quetzalcoatl: all this is the subject of active debate.  &lt;p&gt;
This time will also mark a United States change in era where we will elect a new President.  Is this the prophecy of the Antichrist?  Could it be the end of one time and the beginning of the final stages of centuries of prophecies?" />
