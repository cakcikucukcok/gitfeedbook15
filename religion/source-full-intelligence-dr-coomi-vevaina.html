  <title>Source-Full Intelligence - Dr. Coomi Vevaina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Source-Full Intelligence, Understanding Uniqueness and Oneness through Education is a groundbreaking book which will give you an entirely new understanding of holistic education. Written by an internationally renowned educator, teacher trainer and researcher, the book is intended for all who love and care for children and young adults. It details the toxicity of our educational systems and offers viable alternatives in order to make the process of education a joyful one for learners. It urges all care givers and educators to begin by developing their own Source-full Intelligence to enable them to understand the dual capacity that we humans have of conceptualising and experiencing our uniqueness and oneness, and pass on this understanding to learners. With the help of two lesson plans in the final chapter, it demonstrates how we can fruitfully replace the Self-versus-Other consciousness with a Self-and-Other consciousness and lead children to an even higher awareness that all is Self and there is in fact, no Other. By courageously examining our own belief systems and replacing delimiting beliefs with life-enhancing ones, each one of us can, in our own unique way, contribute towards making our rapidly shrinking and increasingly threatened world a better place for ourselves and for the generations to come." />
