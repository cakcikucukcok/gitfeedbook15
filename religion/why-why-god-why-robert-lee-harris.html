  <title>Why Why God Why? - Robert Lee Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;...why, why God, why?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; presents a series of true and&lt;br&gt;
powerful stories about life. Some are conversations with God, and&lt;br&gt;
others are conversations author Robert Lee Harris had with other&lt;br&gt;
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the stories drive home some simple truths about life and its challenges&lt;br&gt;
tales in which God has shown up and provided much-needed&lt;br&gt;
direction. They will encourage you to reach up and grab hold of hope&lt;br&gt;
with both hands, inspire you to rise up in faith, and overcome the&lt;br&gt;
obstacles that are holding you back, then begs you to unlock and open&lt;br&gt;
the door of belief, while stepping into a reality full of your dreams and&lt;br&gt;
aspirations. Our journeys through life may follow many pathssome&lt;br&gt;
leading us in destructive ways that bring great pain which causes our&lt;br&gt;
hearts to be hardened, and others bringing us great joy. The best path,&lt;br&gt;
however, whether it contains pain or joyis the one that leads us to&lt;br&gt;
our Creator. Its in Him that we find our true calling and the purpose&lt;br&gt;
for which we were created, and it is this path that continues to&lt;br&gt;
become brighter and brighter until the perfect day arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Lee Harris has an important&lt;br&gt;
story to tell. From homelessness&lt;br&gt;
during his teenage years to prosperity&lt;br&gt;
and the good life as an adult, Harris&lt;br&gt;
has found the truth in his life through&lt;br&gt;
God. Living life at any level has troubles, &lt;br&gt;
with consequences that could lead to a&lt;br&gt;
destructive life, if not handled correctly.&lt;br&gt;
No one can or will help us the way that&lt;br&gt;
the Creator can help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;He is the way, the truth, and the life.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
