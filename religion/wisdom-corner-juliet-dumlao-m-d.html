  <title>Wisdom Corner - Juliet Dumlao M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After undergoing an intensive and educational religious formation in the way of loving for many years, I found myself sharing several among many other wisdom I have learned along the way, to help enhance not only the personality and attitude, if not life itself, for these similar wisdom opened several horizons of my own life. Thus, hopingly, it will do the same for the others. The above, I published by the Ice Machine wherein workers fill their cup with ice every morning before work, thus help imbibe the wisdom they see and read before the days work. These they freely share with their family back home, friends, and others they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*After reading Wisdom Corner, I saw for myself the interconnectedness of all the events of my life: - a Bachelors of Nursing Graduate of the Philippines, turned into a fulltime housewife and raised two loving accomplished children now adults - and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit that I feel valued and worthy with the time spent in doing the above - with love that goes beyond the physical. I found several more ideas on how life can be enjoyed and lived to the fullest, for I have now realized what I tried to explain before, is Gods will for me. --France D. Frianeza Philippines to Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The book is Wonderful! --Danny Aberin, M.D., Denmark, Europe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Author underwent a formation in loving after she encountered the Spirituality of Jesus Forsaken through the Work of Mary, founded by Chiara Lubich. Through years of exposure to the Word of Life, Living City and an intensive, educational religious experience in her formation in loving also at a time when she was also undergoing her training in the field of her endeavor. Both influenced her community service; her cultural exchange experience; her own contribution in her field of endeavor that she was selected Among 20,000 Candidates as First Among Eleven Others Most Outstanding US Citizen by the Citizenship Council of Metropolitan Chicago, established by President Dwight Eisenhower himself. She tried also to share what opened horizons of her life during her formation and this book is just one of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the First Among eleven others Most Outstanding New Citizen, she gave the acceptance speech which embodied the general wisdom from her formation in loving, and reflected the seeds of not only assimilating, integrating, but contributing to her culture  medicine and community. For every obstacle made use as a springboard is just one of those wisdom and this book is a fruit of such wisdom, having the time serve instead of serving time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
