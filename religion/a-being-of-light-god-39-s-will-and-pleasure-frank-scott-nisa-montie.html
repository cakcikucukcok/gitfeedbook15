  <title>A Being of Light: God&#39;s Will and Pleasure - Frank Scott, Nisa Montie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is important to understand that the Simulator exists to be experienced. Vis a Vis, that which is experienced, exists (as appearances and names). 
Yet, we know that all that is experienced is not real, and there is a lot more that exists that remains unexperienced. Moreover, in order to experience anything, the entity must be consciously aware of that which exists and is real, and since there is much more within the Simulator that remains hidden and unseen, there must be a Source that is Aware and is the First Cause of its existence for it to exist and be experienced, and that Source we call God. 
Additionally, in order for a state of conscious awareness in an entity, known as human by agreement, to exist and be Self-aware because it exists and is real, there must be a God that exists and is real that is both Aware and is Source of that state of heart and mind for it to exist and be experienced. Furthermore, in order for the experience of existence to occur and be experienced, there must be a God that is Source of all that was, is, and will be, for what is known as Creation, for that to exist, be real, and be experienced. For all this to be what it is, there must be a purpose, a direction, and a significance that all entities need to explore and discover, acknowledge and accept, appreciate and Remember its Cause , in order to Return and experience the SourceGod!" />
