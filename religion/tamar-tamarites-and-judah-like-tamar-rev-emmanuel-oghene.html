  <title>Tamar, Tamarites and Judah-Like Tamar - Rev Emmanuel Oghene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#39;Tamar, Tamarites, and Judah-like Tamar&#39;&lt;/strong&gt;, unveils one of the greatest mysteries surrounding the subject of greatness, inheritance and, or succession, even when the inheritor or heir is not fully aware of the force of destiny at work in his life and experiences. Tamar, though a daughter-in-law, became appreciably more prominent than the sons of Judah that she married when the genealogy of Judah and mankinds Messiah from Abraham through to David and beyond was traced. She broke the tradition that denied her the right of strong-say in the matters of inheritance in the family she married into and become a reference point. This is a great lesson for mankind. There is the story of a man allotted his only house (a one story building) to his eldest sons wife because he claimed she was the only person closest to him who made it a duty to bring his meals to his home for the remaining years of his life that he lived as a widower. He said he had shared the legacy of education up to the university level to all his biological children and owed them nothing else. He placed a curse on whoever would not allow the favoured daughter-in-law to enjoy the inheritance he gave her. Meanwhile, the daughter-in-law merely took to heart the counsel or teaching of her parents to care for her parents-in-law like she would do for her own parents if she desired to enjoy her marriage. They had taught her that as long as she went out of her way to care for her parents-in-law, they would protect her marriage from unbearable bad treatment by her husband and other family members. She gained more than she anticipated from heeding this parental counsel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
