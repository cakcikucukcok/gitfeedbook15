  <title>Terror to Triumph - Dwight E. Vilhauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;...so that when the day of evil comes,&lt;br&gt;
you may be able to stand your ground...&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
If you could view this world through the eyes of God Himself, how much more might you understand? How much wiser would you be? If you could know God&#39;s heart, how might your heart be changed?
&lt;p&gt; 
We are living through one of the most tragic events in world history. September 11 will forever stand as a new benchmark for evil in this world. At the first year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Dwight Vilhauer offers an insightful and reflective look at these tragic events, in his new book, &lt;b&gt;TERROR to TRIUMPH; A Christian Perspective On 9-11&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;p&gt; 
The events of September 11 have raised anew those challenging questions dealing with the problem of evil in the world. How can it coexist with God&#39;s love? As the author points out, &quot;We continue to struggle with the problem of evil because it repeatedly challenges trust in our Creator as a God of love. September 11 is the latest, and perhaps one of the most profound examples of how evil can shake our faith to its core. We need to hear God&#39;s voice now more than ever, for strength and healing. At this turbulent and spiritually challenging point in time, when our ears have been filled with evil&#39;s threatening voice and news of terror reverberates unceasingly from every corner of the media, God still speaks. If we take time to listen to His voice, amidst all the noise and confusion, we will find solid foundational answers to our many questions.&quot;
 &lt;p&gt;
In &lt;b&gt;TERROR to TRIUMPH&lt;/b&gt;, Dwight Vilhauer leads you back to God&#39;s comforting voice where peace and rest are found. Discover how God works in a multitude of ways, through evil&#39;s great onslaught, to guide us, protect us, and lead us to ultimate victorywhenever the day of evil comes.
 &lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TERROR to TRIUMPH&lt;/b&gt; is built upon eight insights that provide a basis for exploring how God works through the evil in this world to accomplish greater ends. Historical events from the Bible, and the teachings of our Savior Jesus Christ, are employed as launching points to explain how God&#39;s past victories over evil have direct application to victories that can be realized today.
 &lt;p&gt;
However, the book is not just about September 11. As the author observes, &quot;It&#39;s really about how to deal with tragedy whenever the day of evil comes, and in whatever way it enters a person&#39;s life. My goal was to help people view the world through the eyes of God Himself and to become one with Him in understanding and purpose. I believe that is how the greatest victory over evil is realized.&quot;
 &lt;p&gt;
From this vantage point, the reader is able to view issues of good vs. evil from a unique and spiritually edifying perspective. The result is an extremely refreshing and spiritually uplifting experience." />
