  <title>Always Ready - Rev. Ronald A. Hotrum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people consider themselves Christians but are not sure theyre going to heaven. Do you know how to help them, how to answer their questions, how to pray for them as well as how to pray with them so they will know how God really forgives, not how they think He does? &lt;em&gt;Always Ready &lt;/em&gt;features dozens of examples of real people who have been led out of their confusion to genuine faith in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ever, pastors and serious Christian lay people need the message and challenge of this book. It flows easily from the heart and life of one who has walked the pathway of following the mandate of Jesus to take His message to the hurting, the sick, the wounded, the lonely, the confused of this world. It will send a sensitive pastor to his knees to ask God for a burning heart, and he will share that with the flock committed to his care. Ronald Hotrum has spoken his heart...a heart that has lived every moment of this Christ-honoring record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert L. Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor, Greek, Bible, biblical and pastoral theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethel College, Mishawaka, Indiana&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend this book to every Christian who is seriously interested in sharing their faith with pre-Christians and making a difference in Kingdom expansion. The book, &lt;em&gt;Are You Ready?&lt;/em&gt; is, by far, the most helpful one I have read on how to pray and the need to clearly understand and articulate forgiveness. Pastor Hotrums personal stories and experiences of leading people to Christ will keep you motivated to read more. This book is a simple treasure in assisting the Church to more effectively bring in the Harvest!&lt;/p&gt;
