  <title>The Saint Germain Chronicles Collection - Gordon Corwin Ii Lah Rahn Ananda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In and throughout The Saint Germain Chronicles Collection, Saint Germain directly and brilliantly speaks to you in His own impeccable style, Delivering His Masterful words, concise and witty, focused upon Essential Keys for Self-transformation. He speaks clearly and specifically on how to gracefully harness and apply Practical Spirituality into your life, including revelations about conquering and Mastering the Human condition within, sealed in a personal relationship invitation from Saint Germain himself. 
This gift of guidance toward Ascending into your Souls pinnacle of heightened, and aligned consciousness as a Multi-dimensional Being, while yet walking grounded and aware upon this 3rd Dimensional Earth-plane, is Saint Germains grandest embrace. Here for you now are these meticulously channeled and often mysterious Chronicles of Light, to fully engage you in The Grand Process, with love and compassion opening vibrations of Mastery and Freedom which transcend the binding ties of all Earthly religions. 
Woven here into these pages of original transmissions are 14 of Saint Germains Essential Keys to Self-transformation for your Mastery and Karmic balance. These Keys act as Gateways to individual empowerment for those who truly seek to transcend the ordinary and enter portals of the Extra-Ordinary that embrace an enlightened consciousness, living within a self-examined lifetime of aligned purpose. By applying these principles to day-by-day living, multiple Synchronicities often become common, shedding Light upon Discovering Ones Dharma, and the walk of Spiritual Partnership that follows. 
Among a vast myriad of Highlights within these works, Saint Germain addresses an on-going, challenging, and pivotal Human dilemma: how to compassionately tackle and vibrationally uplift your barrage of incoming, lingering emotions, along with free-will choices and behavior.
Treat yourself to Drinking Honey Outside of the Hive, and be held in the sweet embrace of Saint Germain speaking from the Divine Mind. As ego would surrender, this Tool box of Masterful Wisdom and Light can serve to be your own Masters Guidebook, a Spiritual Companion at your side, to read, re-read and refer to over the course of your lifetimes Journey into Practical Spirituality." />
