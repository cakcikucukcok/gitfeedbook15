  <title>The Sunset of Science and the Risen Son of Truth - Calvin W. Allison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a unique work of literature, author Calvin W. Allison presents The Sunset of Science and the Risen Son of Truth. The book contains a very stylistic compilation of important topics presented in various forms of writing, including diverse styles of poetry, illustrations, scenarios, analogies, articles, a deeply insightful novella, and a revision of his personal biography. While the Gospel is the centerpiece in this thought-provoking project, the subject matter also branches out to touch on science, politics, environmental issues, and a smidgen of other topics that will align together in a compatible fashion. 
Calvin wants to open up the readers understanding on a variety of issues while simultaneously expanding their thought process so that they will be able to distinguish between truth and fiction in a time when distortions are regularly passed through the airwaves of the media outlets. 
The novella included in this work is titled Mental Dexterity. It is a highly informative tale of a talk-show host named Cal, who, in a time when distortions are frequently broadcast to the general public as reliable news, has a keen sense of detecting truth by making connections in details that arent meant to be connected. While some are critical of Cals ability, referring to it as forming perception puzzles, others are threatened by what he is able to perceive, and soon he finds himself in deep societal waters. 
So brace yourself for the momentum. Because youre about to be engulfed in a mental sphere of intrigue while being intellectually saturated in a stimulating shower of well-prepped penmanship articulated to communicate important information that will work to strengthen your understanding on life-affecting issues." />
