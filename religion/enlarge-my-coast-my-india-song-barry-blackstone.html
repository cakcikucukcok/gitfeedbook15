  <title>Enlarge My Coast: My India Song - Barry Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enlarge My Coast tells of Pastor Blackstone&#39;s return to India to see the completion of a project inspired during his first trip to the subcontinent of Asia in 2006. This time his traveling companion will be a church deacon of the Emmanuel Baptist Church, Russ Coffin. Blackstone and Coffin travel to Kerala State to help in the dedication of the new Venmony Baptist Church sanctuary and parsonage built through the support of their ministry in Maine. Once again Pastor Blackstone is able to share the wonders and wants of India through the eyes of another adventurous traveler. Enjoy with them the fascination of watching a working elephant beside a rural road; the attempt of catching on film five people on a motorcycle at one time; a houseboat ride on Kerala&#39;s largest lake; listening to Russ&#39;s first sermon; graduation day at Kerala Baptist Bible College; an Indian barbeque of pancakes and omelets; of trying to find a bell for the college in the busy and confusing markets of one of Kerala&#39;s biggest cities; and an auto-rickshaw ride through rubber tree-lined lanes, banana grove-covered valleys, and an Indian road repair crew! As in his other India books, Though None Go with Me and Though One Go with Me, share the practical spiritual lessons Pastor Blackstone learned on this, his third India journey and his first mission trip to the State of Andrah Pradesh as the guest evangelist for the Independent Gospel Baptist Churches of India. Share in the personal experience of a daylong journey on the infamous Indian railway into the backcountry of central India, of driving a bullock cart, eating an Indian catfish, making friends with a dog named Ellie, preaching in a thatched-roof church, being surprised by a police raid at four in the morning, and witnessing more people coming to Christ at one time than at any other time in the pastor&#39;s ministry. Journey for a month into the unpredictable land of India and enjoy the surprises around each corner as Pastor Blackstone travels to three Indian states and gets to meet fellow pastors from five states. The fellowship will be sweet, the food will be hot, and the friendships made will be eternal!" />
