  <title>The Mystery of Iniquity - J. J. Cavali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="(Ecc. 1:9) The thing that has been it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be; and there is no new thing under the sun. History constantly repeats itself, thereby becoming the pathway into the future. The things that have passed shall pass by again.
(Lk. 21:28) Prophecy is written as both a warning and as a preparation. Mankind does not learn the hard lessons from repetitive history.
(Mt. 24:48) All these things that the world is currently witnessing are the beginning of birth pains, indicating that birth is imminent.
(2 Thess. 2:78) The revelation of the Mystery of Iniquity is soon to come.
The Greek word for iniquity is anomia, which can be translated as illegality, violation of the law, or lawlessness. Iniquity, or lawlessness, was already at work during Pauls day, is presently at work in our day, and will be manifested in its fullness, one future day. The Mystery of Iniquity is in reference to the wicked one yet to come, who will be empowered, controlled, and inhabited by Satan. (Rev. 13:2). This is the totality of evil expressed and revealed through the union of one man with one demonic spirit. (Mt. 24:12) Because iniquity abounds, the love of many will grow cold and calloused, as the end time draws near, causing a massive increase in violence, brutality, murder, and hatred." />
