  <title>The Strong Delusion - John W. Milor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Milors fascinating work is based on the Bible telling of a powerful deception that will overshadow the Earth, a deception so intense that only those with a genuine love relationship with God will be able to endure it. Events from the authors own life, including a series of supernatural encounters, have revealed some key components of this strong delusion, which he believes will initiate a grand display of open contact with extraterrestrials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also involve the global rise of Islam. Its no mistake that the faiths of four billion people (Christians and Muslims) include two versions of prophetic visions that are nearly identical, yet they represent opposite sides of a global conflict that will end in the Battle of Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book delves into myriad topics, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Encounters with angels, otherworldly beings, and Jesus Christ;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Encounters with demons, ghosts, nephilim, jinns, and mythical creatures;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Bibles explanation of ET good guys and bad guys;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Quran and Hadiths ET connection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Was Muhammad abducted as a boy, and operated on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Was the angel that abducted Muhammad really Gabriel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Were the mysterious jinns of Islam actually surviving nephilim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Is the Quran and Hadiths ideology specifically tailored for the Antichrist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and other topics harken to ancient times and peer into a not-too-distant future, when the author believes we will see a return to the days of Noah, as prophesied by Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
