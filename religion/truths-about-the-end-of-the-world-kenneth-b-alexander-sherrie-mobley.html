  <title>Truths About the End of the World - Kenneth B. Alexander, Sherrie Mobley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The so called &amp;quot;End of the World&amp;quot; is on everyone&amp;#39;s minds today. On the internet, television and the airwaves we are bombarded with graphic visions of the total destruction of the earth as we know it. Prophets and ancient civilization&amp;#39;s writings and hieroglyphs are used to foretell visions of destruction and annihilation of everything we hold dear. So-called prophets such as Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, and other self-proclaimed prognosticators (even Isaac Newton) are quoted widely as predictors of the end. Civilizations, such as the Mayans, the Hopi Indians, the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Jews, the Christians and countless others have their own interpretations of the end of days. Some go so far as to predict the exact day and hour of the end (Mayan 2012). So far each prior prediction has been proven wrong, and probably will be proven wrong in the future. Only God knows the day and hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although these writings will use the Holy Bible as the source of most of its observations that does not mean this writing is simply more Christian dogma. Most Christian denominations and churches today do not know any more about the end of days than what is cryptically written in the Bible. This work is not about religion although it is about God, or a higher power, that actually does exist and exerts the only viable influence on matters pertaining to the earth, His creation. It is in finding this God that we find our salvation, and our protection in the coming days. This work, after extensive studies of many world religions, will choose to use the Bible as the most complete and accurate picture of this God with whom we have to deal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus Christ said: &amp;quot;Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour&amp;quot; (Matthew 25:13, ISV). &amp;quot;Jesus said that no man knows the day or the hour of His coming&amp;quot; (Matthew 24:36), but He urges us to be ready for it. The greatest mistake we could make would be to state dogmatically that we know exactly how everything will fall into place as many, especially Christian believers do. Just before the outpouring of the Spirit recorded in Acts 2, the disciples asked the Lord if He would at that time restore the Kingdom to Israel. He answered by saying that it was &amp;quot;not for them to know the times or seasons which the Father had placed in His own hand&amp;quot; (Acts 1:6&amp;ndash;7). Jesus could have known anything, but evidently there were some things that the Father willed Him not to know. Jesus did not know the hour of His return. Even the angels do not know. Then how can men dogmatic about predicting the hour or the way of the future. ? Let our only concern be that we are ready, that we walk on with God. This is the will of God: &amp;quot;that our whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord. Let God sanctify us wholly and completely&amp;quot; (I Thessalonians 5:23)" />
