      <meta name="description" content="WARNING!
It has been noted that anyone who reads and hears everything
written in this book, may result in changes in their understanding,
finances, health and anyone around them.
This book was not written so you can read and hear about all the
miracles God did for me. On the contrary, this book was written
solely with the purpose of what God can and will do for you. The
instructions written in this book, are not written so you can read
and hear about how God answered my prayers, needs and wants.
The instructions written in this book are all about how God can and
will answer all of your prayers, needs and wants, today, tomorrow
and forever. It wasnt until I took the time to read and hear Gods
instructions to make all of this possible and not impossible. In Mat.
19: 26, Gods word says, With God all things are possible. and
my life has never been the same. If you are not happy with the way
your life is going or something has been missing and you cant quite
put your finger on it. You are closer than you think. Your first step,
is this book in your hands and only you can change all of this right
now; I cant do it for You. If you take the time to read and hear
what God has in these instructions for you, your life will never be
the same.
I Love you in the Lord always
