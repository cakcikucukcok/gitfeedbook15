  <title>Holy Subversion (Foreword by Ed Stetzer) - Trevin Wax, Ed Stetzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christians are too often guilty of pledging their allegiance to the influential principalities and powers of this age rather than to Christ alone. In &lt;em&gt;Holy Subversion&lt;/em&gt;, Trevin Wax challenges such behavior by urging a return to the subversive lifestyle of the earliest Christians. Their proclamation and demonstration that &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; directly opposed the Caesar worship of their day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today, Christians in the West must choose between Jesus and our &quot;Caesars&quot;: self, success, money, leisure, sex, power. What would it look like, asks Wax, if today&#39;s church reclaimed the communal, subversive nature of the gospel, intentionally undermining all contenders for our devotion? How would the message that &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; change our thinking about our jobs, our families, and our church participation? Here this gifted pastor-theologian offers help in taking our faith public, dethroning modern-day Caesars, honoring the Lordship of Christ, and understanding the church as the ultimate counterculture-an embodiment of Christ&#39;s supremacy over all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
