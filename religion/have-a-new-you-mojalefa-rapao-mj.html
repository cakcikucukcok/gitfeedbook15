  <title>Have a New You! - Mojalefa Rapao (Mj)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Things can change, and you can create your future now.
Most likely, you have tried a few things along the way to become a new you. You have tried . . . and failed. This time, its going to be different. You will become a new you. But its a little scary, right? After all, being in a rut is sometimes a lot more comfortable. To make any change, you have to decide you want to make that change and be willing to do the work required to get there.
Why be less when you can be more?
You are not your past just as you are not your future. If you dwell on the past, you tend to rely on past experiences too much to make your decisions. Remember, you are capable of more than you achieved in the past. The moment you change your thoughts, you change your world. Change is a knowledge thing! Just do it! What you really want in your life now may have changed dramatically from old goals. If you neglect to question yourself about this, you can easily end up following old patterns. Remember, the actions you take in here and now create the many possible futures that can exist for you.
Choosing to stand still means that in fact you can go backward because the world changes around you. And when your world changes, even in small ways, you eventually get dragged along, sometimes kicking and screaming because not everyone embraces change. Just recognizing that change is inevitable can be a relief. Putting yourself in charge of the changes you experience make the journey a lot more enjoyable. 
Accept the truth about yourself.
Boost your confidence by identifying the lies you are telling yourself and putting them to the rest for good.
Change your life by concentrating on becoming who you really want to be in life." />
