  <title>Fresh Spring - Gregory Chigozie Nnaji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gregory Nnaji revives the spirit of the early twentieth century Christian writers. Unlike the vast majority of authors today that focus on how-tos and building a better me, Gregory places his emphasis on the supremacy of Christ and His work within the believer. His books are birthed out of personal prayer, struggle, and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Gregorys latest work is no exception.
Fresh Spring is, as the title implies, a fresh perspective on the power of God working within the believer. Ranging from subjects such as the near insanity of rebellion against God, to the blessedness of unity, Fresh Spring takes the reader on a spiritual journey that challenges the heart and satiates the soul. The focus is on the believer who wants more, who is searching for depth in his or her Christian experience. The reader will especially find the personal stories of struggle and victory, born out of Gregorys recent past, to bring life to the chapters as well as offer practical application to the topics studied. Thanks to the transparent words of Fresh Spring, you may very well feel that you have known Gregory for a long time!
I have been blessed to be Gregorys pastor and have witnessed firsthand his deep commitment to Christ and loving expression of the Christian faith. He and his family have made great sacrifices to serve God wholeheartedly. I trust that you will find his spiritual memoirs of Fresh Spring as a catalyst for a deeper, fresher relationship with Christ." />
