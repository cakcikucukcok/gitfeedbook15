  <title>But the Greatest of These Is Love - Eward M. Vigeant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This new Thought System emphasizes application rather than theology. It specifically states that a universal religion is impossible, but a Universal Experience is not only possible, but also necessary. This Universal Experience is Love. Universal means that all of the billions of people who have passed through this world since time began and all of the people who are here now (seven billion) would know God. God is Love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know Gods Love within is to know God. Where learning ends, there is Love. Love is not learned. There was never a time in which you knew it not. Once this new perception of God is accepted, then everything changes. The quiet Voice of Love will help you to reinterpret everything you have been taught as fearful and that makes you feel guilty and will change them to... only what is loving is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no rules and regulations to obey. You need do nothing. The Power of Love will set you free. It is not through any of your efforts. Here is the ultimate release, which everyone will one day find in his own way, at his own time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about this: If Love is the primary focus of your life, what are you going to do wrong? - Fear God and keep His commandments becomes Know God and accept His Certainty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wikepedia, it is estimated that there are approximately 4,200 religions in the world today. I say&lt;/p&gt;
