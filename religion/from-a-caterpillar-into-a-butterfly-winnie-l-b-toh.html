  <title>From a Caterpillar into a Butterfly - Winnie L.B.Toh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Atrue testimony of a non-believer went for a Beauty Pageant Contest with the theme From a Caterpillar to a Butterfly and underwent an amazing metamorphosis, being transformed into a child of God.
Out of curiosity, Winnie Toh participated in a nationwide beauty pageant contest. Having shortlisted in the semi-finals, she encountered a Satanic attack and was tormented to the brink of death. Despite trying all sorts of methods to survive, she was inevitably heading towards her own death. At the point of a near-death experience, she received an SMS from a Christian friend, encouraging her to surrender her life to Jesus.  Already spiritually dead and with nothing to lose, Winnie mentally surrendered herself to Jesus. Gods miracles began to work: She was delivered from a physical death, and now she is a new creation in Christ, burning with passion to share with everybody the story of her life-transforming journey.
Sometimes we can feel we have hit rock-bottom in every aspect of our lives. As much as we may try to work our way out of the holewhether spiritual, financial, or emotionalit seems hopeless. Satan has his grip on us, and he is not inclined to release his grasp.
Author Winnie L.B.Toh knows what it is like to suffer at Satans hands. From a Caterpillar into a Butterfly is her testimony of an amazing personal metamorphosis where she ended up finding God. Gods love immediately began to work in her life. She was saved spiritually and physically.
If you ever wonder how it feels like going through a metamorphosis, transforming from a caterpillar into a butterfly, read and experience every single part of the story with the Author!" />
