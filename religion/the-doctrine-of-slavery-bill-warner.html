  <title>The Doctrine of Slavery - Bill Warner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The modern historical theory of slavery is that white men brought Africans to the Western hemisphere, where they were sold for profit and put to work as slaves. The modern theory is true as far as it goes, but it does not go nearly far enough. Slavery goes far beyond the 300-year period when whites bought slaves from the Muslim wholesalers on the West coast of Africa. For 1400 years Islam waged jihad in Africa, India and Europe to enslave non-Muslims. Islam ran the slave markets, not only on the West coast of Africa, but in North Africa and East Africa. The foundation for this business was the Islamic doctrine that makes slavery a moral virtue. Mohammed&amp;#39;s example established the way to be the perfect slave trader and slave owner. He sold slaves he captured to finance jihad. Islam has a highly detailed doctrine of slavery. This book is a fascinating study of the ideology that supported the world&amp;#39;s largest slave culture and still sells slaves today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
