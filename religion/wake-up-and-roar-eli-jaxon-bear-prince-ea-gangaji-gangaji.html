  <title>Wake Up and Roar - Eli Jaxon-Bear, Prince Ea, Gangaji Gangaji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sri H.W.L. Poonja, - known to the world as Papaji introduced satsang to the West. First through his student Gangaji, and this book, and later other students of his, satsang has now spread throughout the world. His radical transmission of a silent mind and the possibility of instant awakening through direct self-discovery has already made a huge impact in spiritual seekers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pure teaching of self-inquiry, dating back to the ancient Greek philosophers, there is no religion, no dogma, no rules and no hierarchy in Papaji&amp;rsquo;s teaching. He said that just a human life is enough of a requirement to wake up and be free and to live a life of love and peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken from questions and answers with seekers from around the world, Wake Up and Roar creates a flow designed to awaken the reader to their own true nature. Wake Up and Roar offers the reader an opportunity to awaken, here and now, regardless of background, practice, or personal circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blending humor, logic, and eye-opening storytelling, Papaji extends a gracious wisdom that speaks to the earnest seeker investigating the nature of mind, enlightenment, and how to be in the world. In Wake Up and Roar, he brings confirmation and help to practitioners from all traditions, at any stage of their inquiry into awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading the first copy of this book out loud, Papaji laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;Now I understand why people are writing to me saying that they are waking up just from reading this book!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First printed in 1992, and available in six languages, this perennial classic, now with forewords by Gangaji and Prince Ea, continues to inspire a new generation of truth seekers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
