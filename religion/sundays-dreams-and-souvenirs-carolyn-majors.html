  <title>Sundays, Dreams and Souvenirs - Carolyn Majors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sundays, Dreams, and Souvenirs is a book of joys, sorrows, searching, praying, and loving. It is a book of the sharing of insights of childhood and adulthoodall merged into one as a whole.&lt;br&gt;
There are reflections on growing upon being a child, on learning as an adult, and the lessons of childhood . . . again.&lt;br&gt;
We are all travelers on this journey called life. We bring along with us the souvenirs from the pastthe joyous days of childhood, and running free, the adult years. Looking back, the pain of rejection and heartbreak; the poignant love of family; the lessons learned in giving, in praying, in hoping, in witnessing death and dying, only to emerge into a newness of life; in witnessing life in all its beauty, in all its trauma and joy; but always keeping our eyes on the love of God, the love of family, and the dreams that we keep in our heart, which can see us through the challenges of life at every turn.&lt;br&gt;
We need to trust God in these pages, to open up to a world that can be and is really within each of our grasps.&lt;br&gt;
It is a world of wonder, awe, and beauty, but also one of painstaking trust in giving to God each moment of our lives, to the Creator who formed us in our mothers womb, and to give him back a life of tenacity and strength and total joy.&lt;br&gt;
