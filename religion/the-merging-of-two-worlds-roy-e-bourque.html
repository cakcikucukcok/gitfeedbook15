  <title>The Merging of Two Worlds - Roy E. Bourque</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/b&gt; is a left-brained subject. It sees the world in mathematical models. It is all built on logic. &lt;b&gt;RELIGION&lt;/b&gt; is a right-brained subject. It sees the world in associations. It is all built on symbolism. Misconceptions are what prevent us from reconciling the associations with the mathematical models. Once the misconceptions are revealed, the problem goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teachings of Eastern Philosophy are interwoven throughout the Old and New Testaments. What they have to say explains a great deal about what the Holy Bible is trying to say to us. It reveals much of the symbolism used in religion so that it can be understood. It takes you beyond the realm of faith and into the realm of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayan Calendar and its apparent connection to end-time prophecy is also reviewed. The evolution of consciousness that it reveals is leading us on a very definite path. Taken collectively, evolution, split brain, Eastern Philosophy, Christianity, and the Mayan Calendar are interwoven to present a worldview that is equally fascinating and very promising.&lt;/p&gt;" />
