  <title>A Reluctant Journey - Kristen Grathwol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Where do you turn when pain doesnt diminish, and turns into a constant companion? What does it look like to lean on the Lord for strength when every day is a struggle? In A Reluctant Journey, Kristen Grathwol shares her past and present battles with the chronic pain of fibromyalgia. Weaving personal experience with reflections on Scripture, A Reluctant Journey shows how the cycle of chronic pain can lead to a spiritual cycle of trust and praise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In journal entries that lay bare the doubts and difficulties of chronic pain, along with the joy that comes from surrendering to the One who knows our deepest hurt, A Reluctant Journey explores five facets of this theme: trusting God, surrendering control, praising God in the midst of suffering, learning how to rest and grieve, and seeking community. When we trust God, we are freed from our desire to control, even to the point of embracing our trials. Even when God chooses not to change our circumstances, surrender brings joy and moves us to praise Him for His goodness and His plan in our lives. Yet God also knows our grief and wants us to bring Him our sorrows as well. Seeking God rescues us from the isolating power of pain and restores us to community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting this cycle is not a once-and-for-all decision, but a daily choice. An encouragement to those struggling with long-term trials, A Reluctant Journey offers a scriptural message of hope and healing for pain both physical and emotional.&lt;/p&gt;" />
