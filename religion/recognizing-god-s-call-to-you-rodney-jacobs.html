      <meta name="description" content="Dear Bro. Rodney,
I deeply appreciate your book, Recognizing God&#39;s Call to You. Its practical and biblically based messages are timely. Given our world of constant change and continual information, persons are in need of proven truths that will help them go the distance with confidence and joy. Thank you providing such a rich and insightful collection of spiritual nuggets.
Moreover, thank you for giving yourself over to the spiritual writing craft. I look forward to reading more from you.
Blessings on Blessings,
