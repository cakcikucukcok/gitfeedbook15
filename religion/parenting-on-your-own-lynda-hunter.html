  <title>Parenting on Your Own - Lynda Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What you hoped for in life was a smooth road with enough turns to make it interesting. As a single parent, what you got was a rocky path marked by money issues, a barren social life, and more to do in one day than most people accomplish in three.  Dr. Lynda Hunter knows how hard it can be. Her own experience as a single parent has taught her firsthand about the concerns you face daily. It’s also taught her how to handle those concerns effectively. Now, in Parenting On Your Own, Dr. Hunter combines her personal insights with those of hundreds of single parents across the country to offer this first-of-its-kind, definitive handbook for single parents.  Here at last are the real-life answers you’ve longed for to the real-life questions you’ve been asking about - coping with isolation, loneliness, and other emotions - being a full-time parent and making a living and having a social life - filling in the gaps left by the missing parent - dealing with financial crunches . . . and much more.  You won’t find a more thorough, practical, and well-researched guide to single parenting anywhere. This timely resource not only supplies help for your greatest struggles, but new hope and encouragement a single parent’s best allies." />
