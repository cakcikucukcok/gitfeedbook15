  <title>Healing Journey - Dolly Little</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the first five decades of her life, Dolly
wore her inferiority complex like a second
skin. It was so much a part of her that she
didnt even know it was there. Possibly nobody
else did either.
At the age of four she was told, by her birth
Mother, big girls dont cry. So from that time
on she didnt!! Except when she absolutely
couldnt help it and then she would go away
on her own so that she wouldnt be a nuisance
or make anyone cross with her. It was the age
when children were seen but not heard.
Just before her eighth birthday her Father left without saying Goodbye and
this resulted in her Mother having to put Dolly and her little sister into foster
care. There were three homes, the first was only temporary whilst a permanent
one was found. The second was not a happy experience for Dolly but the third
was just magic. She felt so lucky to be a part of Mums family.
In decade number six there were many changes in Dollys life, she walked away
from a thirty year marriage and set up home on her own, not an easy thing
to do. Many new friends came into her life and between them they managed
to teach her how to value herself. It took a lot of patience and persistence but
gradually the healing took hold and is still continuing today. By helping others
she found that she was helping herself too, magic." />
