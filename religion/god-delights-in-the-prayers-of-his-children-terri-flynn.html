      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Are you tired of your prayers lacking power? Would you like them to be authoritative and prevailing instead? If youre ready for a revitalized prayer life that illustrates the marvelous capability of your Christian walk, then &lt;i&gt;God Delights in the Prayers of His Children&lt;/i&gt; can help you get there.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This collection of faith-building prayers is a powerful resource, designed to encourage believers to communicate intimately with God.

&lt;P&gt;Flynn shares her spiritual experiences by using devotional prayers and commentary to illustrate how to have a personal relationship with God. She explores some of the doubts, fears, and perplexities we experience and offers prayers that address these issues. In addition, she reveals the four basic elements of prayer, as well as methods for establishing a prayer life and interceding with power.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you desire an intimate relationship with God, &lt;i&gt;God Delights in the Prayers of His Children&lt;/i&gt; provides a foundation to help you develop a life-changing commitment to prayer. Connect your spirit to the knowledge of Gods Word through prayer and see Him work in your life!&lt;/P&gt;" />
