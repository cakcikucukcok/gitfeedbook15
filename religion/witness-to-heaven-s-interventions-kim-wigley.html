      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When were traveling on the road of life, we are often confronted with important questions: Does God listen? Does he care about our normal, everyday lives? Will he answer our prayers? And do miracles happen today? We hope to find answers to these questions, and thankfully, God has provided signs and a road map to help us along the way. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Witness to Heavens Interventions: A Truckers Story, author and truck driver Kim Wigley shares his personal testimony of how God has been there for him to answer the tough questions in life. From his early childhood years to his family life as a father, Kim reminds us that God is always with us and cares about us. Kims stories from the road will inspire you to stay faithful and believe in the miraculous blessings that only God can provide. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many forks on the road of life, and if we trust in God and choose the way of salvation through Jesus Christ, then we can be sure that God will lead us on the road to lasting peace, hope, and joy with him at the last stopeternity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
