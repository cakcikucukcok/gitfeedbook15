  <title>Just a Closer Walk - Jerry Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Just a Closer Walk&lt;/i&gt;, author Jerry Marshall, a Christian Correctional Officer, offers a unique perspective on his work experience and personal life. As God challenged him, he in turn wrote devotionals to encourage himself and others to experience a closer walk with Christ. We all experience loneliness, depression, anger, fear, or helplessness at some point in our lives. Through short, personal stories, Marshall tells us about how he dealt with these issues and shows how we can also overcome them to have a victorious life in Christ. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall takes examples from the Word of God and from his experiences and applies them to the problems each of us face on a daily basis. He has encountered the pains and trials of those behind prison walls, a wide range of people with many issues and difficulties, and explains how Christs love brought healing power into the prisons darkness. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just a Closer Walk&lt;/i&gt;, seeks to offer comfort to the hurting and encourages them to trust in God. He challenges those who feel they are settling for stale bread when they can experience the Bread of Life. Marshall speaks from his heart about Gods love, righteousness, and desire to draw His children into a closer walk with Him.&lt;/P&gt;" />
