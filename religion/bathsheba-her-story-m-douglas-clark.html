      <meta name="description" content="For centuries Bathsheba has been accused of seducing King David to worm her way into the royal family and then helping to engineer his downfall. She did nothing wrong; it was David who committed power rape and unleashed a series of events with a profound impact on his reign and Jewish history. Guided by the prophet Nathan Bathsheba successfully navigated her way through the treacherous world of an imperial palace. She became the mother and first teacher of Solomon, one of the wisest and wealthiest kings in history, who placed her on a throne next to his. 
Bathshebas story is one of the worlds literary gems. It contains a complete inventory of human traits: love and hate, revenge and forgiveness, kindness and cruelty, wisdom and stupidity, courage and cowardice, murder and incest, destructive
treachery and inspiring fidelity. 
Based entirely on Scripture and recent archeological discoveries here is her timeless story, told from her perspective." />
