  <title>Book of Short Stories - Alexander C. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book of Short Stories presents a collection of short stories that have been written over a twenty-five-year period. Some were used as closing thoughts given to the boys of several Boy Scout troops at the end of meetings, when author Alexander C. Parker served as both an assistant scoutmaster and as scoutmaster.&lt;br /&gt;
These stories show how God can and does work in the lives of people through the leading of the Holy Spirit and how it is possible to find new direction in your life by letting God and the Holy Spirit speak to you.&lt;br /&gt;
It is hoped that by reading each story and letting the theme of that story remain with you, that it will help in providing a new and stronger positive outlook and make you the reader more confident in your walk of life.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a very clear message on Salvation and several opportunities to accept Jesus Christ as your Personal Lord and Savior.&lt;br /&gt;
Parker is also the author of Jesus of the Future; both books seek to lead readers to understand God more clearly." />
