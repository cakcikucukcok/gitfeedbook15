  <title>Purifying the Heart - James Tarter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Bible the heart represents the whole inner person, the part of a person that receives a new body as he (she) moves from life on earth into the rest of eternity. Because the heart is so vital for each person&#39;s eternal good, our loving God makes His work to purify our hearts a priority.  He is the one who provides real progress, but He also wants each of His children in Jesus to co-operate with His work for our good.  Then what is the problem? There are two key ones: the heart naturally protects itself against getting changed, even by deceiving one&#39;s own mind if necessary; and the devil and demons diligently try to deceive people out of receiving this great good from God in Jesus. This book is written to show Biblical solutions for key heart problems.  I gave this book the same front cover as two other books, so that you can choose the best book for you. This book features the solution with each problem. The other two books are described in the Introduction before Chapter 1." />
