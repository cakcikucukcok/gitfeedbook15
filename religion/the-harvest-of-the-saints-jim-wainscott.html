  <title>The Harvest of the Saints - Jim Wainscott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Harvest of the Saints is a sequel to The Eleventh-Hour Overcomers. Its intent is to continue the overcoming theme by exploring a little-known rapture theory that has been hidden in the shadows for much of the last century. Unlike most rapture scenarios that rely upon a limited framework of supporting Scripture, the harvest concept is based on a compelling body of biblical evidence that also provides insight into other related end-time events. Specific topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clearly defined Old Testament pattern of a traditional harvest and its application to an end-time harvest of the saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Jesus will come both as a thief in the night and visibly in the clouds as our conquering King&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of overcoming and the Lords conditional promise concerning the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3:10)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Why outer darkness and the lake of fire represent two separate areas of confinement established to serve two entirely different purposes 
Why many of the details of Gods meticulously-designed end-time plan have been hidden from our eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join me as we bring the harvest concept out of the shadows and into the light where we can test all things; [and] hold fast what is good (1 Thess. 5:21).
