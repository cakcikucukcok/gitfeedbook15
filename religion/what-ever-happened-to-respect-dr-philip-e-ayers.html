  <title>What Ever Happened to Respect? - Dr. Philip E. Ayers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is there something taking place in our beloved country? It seems the respect for our government, society, and religious institutions are eroding. America is losing its influence and respect as a world leader. Many of our citizens believe our country is beyond saving from absolute destruction. They say we have crossed the threshold of no return. There are many reasons for these thoughts of doom, but one glaring observation stands out. Our citizens are not focused on fundamental family traditions, less government involvement in our lives and strong Christian ethics. There is a silent movement away from respecting the leaders of our government, communities and churches. Our minds are bombarded with thoughts from free thinkers who have no Christian values. Even the mindset of pastors is changing. This is alarming because the fate of our nation rests in the minds of its leaders! 
Dr. Ayers has opened my thinking to the possibility of a potential danger lurking within our churches and society  a failure to respect those in authority. It was difficult for me to accept my role as a pastor in this assault of Satan upon us. I agree with Phil in his assessment that we need a revival! 
                                -A local pastor in the Roanoke Valley
If once you forfeit the confidence of your fellow-citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem. 
                               -Abraham Lincoln
Lord, help us who cannot preach to pray for the man who does! Have you, dear Friend, who cannot preach, made a point of praying for the pastor of the Church to which you belong? It is a great sin on the part of Church members if they do not daily sustain their pastor by their prayers!
                              -Charles Spurgeon -1892, Sermon #2261" />
