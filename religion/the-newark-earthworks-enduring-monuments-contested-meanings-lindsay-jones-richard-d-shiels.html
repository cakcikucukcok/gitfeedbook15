  <title>The Newark Earthworks: Enduring Monuments, Contested Meanings - Lindsay Jones, Richard D. Shiels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considered a wonder of the ancient world, the Newark Earthworks-the     gigantic geometrical mounds of earth built nearly two thousand years ago in the Ohio     valley--have been a focal point for archaeologists and surveyors, researchers and scholars for     almost two centuries. In their prime one of the premier pilgrimage destinations in North     America, these monuments are believed to have been ceremonial centers used by ancestors of     Native Americans, called the &quot;Hopewell culture,&quot; as social gathering places, religious     shrines, pilgrimage sites, and astronomical observatories. Yet much of this territory has been     destroyed by the city of Newark, and the site currently &quot;hosts&quot; a private golf course,     making it largely inaccessible to the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first book-length volume     devoted to the site, &lt;i&gt;The Newark Earthworks&lt;/i&gt; reveals the magnitude and the     geometric precision of what remains of the earthworks and the site&#39;s undeniable importance     to our history. Including contributions from archaeologists, historians, cultural geographers,     and cartographers, as well as scholars in religious studies, legal studies, indigenous studies,     and preservation studies, the book follows an interdisciplinary approach to shine light on the     Newark Earthworks and argues compellingly for its designation as a World Heritage     Site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
