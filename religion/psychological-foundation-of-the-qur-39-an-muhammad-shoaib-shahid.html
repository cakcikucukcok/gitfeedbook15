  <title>Psychological Foundation of the Qur&#39;an - Muhammad Shoaib Shahid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Historically, the need for religion for guidance to promote moral ethical values under the concept of a sole Creator has been established by all the followers of the Holy Books. The Qur&#39;an, which is a continuation as a reformed authentic book, has been either ignored to be comprehended with its meanings or misinterpreted for personal motives by its preachers. Therefore, due to the ignorance of the Qur&#39;anic Abrahamic monotheist concept, various sects, extreme groups, and confrontations have been triggered among the Muslims and rival religious groups. As the present century is based on science and technology, intellectuals and truth seekers judge religious values from logical and scientific perspectives.
 It is a dire necessity in the present era to present Divine knowledge with fundamental concepts and clear misconceptions about Islam with reasoning to attract adolescents and the ignorant toward peace through the Qur&#39;anic treasure of knowledge. Therefore, my presentation of the book, based on these criteria, is about the psychology of religion, basic concepts, and historical aspects for revealing Divine guidance through the Qur&#39;an to Muhammad (PBUH) with his role as Prophet to address the various aspects of human nature. 
As a student of psychology with experience of observing human beings and current human destruction under religious disputes, I have tried to present all of this according to set scientific standards and tools. It has been written objectively in simple English narration with sole reference to the Qur&#39;an to create insight among laypeople, particularly the adolescents (new generation), towards peace, unity and a balanced life pattern leading to human respect and tolerance in an emerging capitalist society." />
