  <title>Drop the Fig Leaf - Everest Bryce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We were not designed to live in this world of deception, lust, judgment, and greed. We were made for freedom, adventure, the infinite, to live freely, openly, honestly and uninhibited. Given the reality of life on earth, leaving ourselves too vulnerable, too exposed to all the selfishness and greed is simply not a viable survival option. All of us eventually have to put up our guard and run for cover. We close ourselves in, put up walls and when that happens, we cover up much of our intended greatness. These coverings we feel forced to place over our hearts, minds, spirits and bodies are the Fig Leaves of our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop the Fig Leaf takes a very straightforward look at these fig leaves, what lies behind them, how did they get there and most importantly, how to remove them. We will look at whats at stake, whats on the other side of the fig-leaves, what was intended for us all along, and how we can fight back and ultimately win the greatest battle of our lives. Get ready for an exhilarating, eye opening and life changing journey - The battle for our original and natural freedom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
