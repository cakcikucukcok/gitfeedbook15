  <title>Cruxifixction’s A Doddle - Julian Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;As Julian Doyle sat in the editing room watching the day’s footage from Monty Python’s seminal film Life of Brian, he began to notice something curious. As two Roman centurions discuss the crucifixion of a prisoner, Doyle thought more about the brutal practice and decided to do some research, beginning with the Bible. It was during his investigation that he began to notice contradictions within the text about the death of Jesus, leading him to the shocking possibility that maybe it wasn’t Pontious Pilate that killed Christ after all, and that perhaps Jesus had actually lived for a decade longer than previously thought.
In Crucifixion’s a Doddle, the irrepressible Doyle uses evidence to form his persuasive case; such as the fact that no image of Jesus on a cross appeared for 300 years after the event was alleged to have taken place, and that the images that did appear were likely an invention by commissioned artists at the time to explore the likelihood that the story told for centuries may not be as accurate as previously thought.
Behind his jovial and playful style, Julian Doyle conceals a rapier wit with which he cuts and slashes his way through the whole of the crucifixion story with expert analysis, bringing clarity to the Gospel and revealing for the first time a way of understanding what may be the true story of Jesus. Leading Python Terry Jones has described Doyle as a polymath, and it is this extraordinary range of knowledge - coupled with a curious and accessible approach - that has helped lead him to his discoveries. Remarkable, challenging and possibly very naughty indeed, Crucifixion’s a Doddle is a must-read for Python fans as well as anyone with an inquiring mind.&quot;" />
