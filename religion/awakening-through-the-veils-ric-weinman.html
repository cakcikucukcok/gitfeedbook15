  <title>Awakening Through the Veils - Ric Weinman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Awakening through the Veils takes the reader, step by step, through the mysterious process of awakening. For most seekers, it will be a direct and practical guide towards an actual awakening. For those already awake, it will help to deepen them from where they are now. 
During the last ten years, I have had the privilege of following Rics awakening path, and it has produced a huge transformation in me. I have worked on my inner constraints, freeing the issues that caused me great fear and suffering. Through Rics guidance, I have been able to walk step by step on a road that leads to awakening to our true nature, creating a life with more freedom and openness. It has been a journey from the shadows to the light. I am completely sure that as you read this book and put your consciousness into it, you will have the same wonderful experience.
Santiago Ardissone, President of the Columbia Foundation on Consciousness and Energy
Of all the teachers, guides, and masters who I have met in my forty years of seeking spiritual fulfillment, Ric Weinman has the ability to map not only consciousness but that most elusive of qualities: awakening. VortexHealing provides a path that anyone can tread to that end. What more can you ask? I thoroughly recommend the VortexHealing path, Ric, and this great book he has written.
