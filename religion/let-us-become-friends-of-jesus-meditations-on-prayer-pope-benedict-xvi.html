  <title>Let Us Become Friends of Jesus: Meditations on Prayer - Pope Benedict XVI</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The human heart longs to be united with God, and it is only in prayer-as we answer God&#39;s invitation to become friends of Jesus-that men and women can satisfy the deepest desires of their heart. These short meditations are taken from Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s audiences, homilies, addresses, and writings from the past seven years of his pontificate, including his most recent catechesis on prayer. Because he is steeped in personal prayer and the liturgical and traditional prayers of the Church, the Holy Father offers us sound and inspiring advice about the essence, art, and practice of prayer. His reflections also provide deep insights into God&#39;s love, Jesus&#39; own prayer, how to pray the psalms meaningfully, and the richness of devotions to the Eucharist and Mary. This is a handbook on prayer that you&#39;ll want to read over and over again." />
