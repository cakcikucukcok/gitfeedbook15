  <title>Beyond Pius V: Conflicting Interpretations of the Liturgical Reform - Andrea Grillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The reform of the liturgy is at risk, says Andrea Grillo. Recent developments have sown doubts and confusion within the church.  While many authorities pay   lip service to the importance of the liturgical reform that followed Vatican II and  cite all the right documents, what they offer is &amp;quot;out of tune&amp;quot; with the fundamental  reasons for the reform.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grillo argues that the church today must refresh its   collective memory of the essential meaning of the liturgical reform. For Grillo, this means understanding&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* the meaning and significance of Vatican II in the history of the church in the twentieth century&lt;br&gt;* the key concept of &amp;quot;active    participation&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;* the core ideas of the original liturgical movement and the role    they played during and after the reform of the liturgy&lt;br&gt;* what the reform has   accomplished and what remains to be done&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beyond Pius V is    not simply a set of pastoral observations. It is a strongly argued theological essay on the true meaning and purpose of liturgy and liturgical reform. That reform, Grillo says, must continue to challenge and provoke us, never to be reduced to the precious past of our ancestors; rather, like children who honor the legacy of their  parents, we are called to carry on and nurture the life of the reform.&lt;/div&gt;" />
