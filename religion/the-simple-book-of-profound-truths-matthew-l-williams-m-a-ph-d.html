  <title>The Simple Book of Profound Truths - Matthew L. Williams  M.A.  Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a revolutionary text for revolutionary spiritual times. Facing imminent global financial collapse and great adversity for the foreseeable future, people will need a powerful faith in God just to survive. But who can have great faith if they dont know anything about God and how he works in our livesor if he even exists? &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God reveals spiritual knowledge to mankind not in an even, continuous flow, but in rare bursts or quantum leaps forward. The last such spiritual burst in Christianity occurred almost 2000 years ago, with the teachings of the New Testament. Since then, virtually no progress has been made in terms of spiritual insight into the Bible. Even worse, scholars today dont understand very well Gods lessons from the last burst. Thats why youll find even prominent Christian teachers still debating such basic spiritual concepts as the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Can non-Christians be saved? &lt;br&gt;
	What is the role of scienceand especially evolutionin relation to the Bible? &lt;br&gt;
	What roles do free will and predestination play in our lives and salvation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, while Christian spirituality has remained stuck in the past, mankind has pushed ahead into the twenty-first century. With the explosive growth of knowledge, science, and global communications, Christianity must improve the way it addresses peoples spiritual concerns or face irrelevance and eventual extinction. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book represents a revolution in spiritual understanding that takes Christianity into the twenty-first century and beyond. It is the latest burst of spiritual insight2000 years in coming. Mankinds oldest and most vexing spiritual questions are answered here in full accord with logic, science, and reason. In addition, the reader will find new insights into understanding the Bible, living a spiritual life, andfor the first time evera new vision of Bible prophecy and the end of the world. There is no book like this.&lt;p&gt;" />
