  <title>Finding God in Silicon Valley  : Spiritual Journeys in a High-Tech World - Skip Vaccarello, Pat Gelsinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God is doing the seemingly impossible in Silicon Valley&amp;mdash;changing the hearts and attitudes of the rich and successful, and those desperately pursuing riches, power, and prestige. Having a tradition of disrupting the status quo with technology, Silicon Valley may be poised to challenge its perception as a wasteland of faith as well. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding God in Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tells how God is working in the lives of people in Silicon Valley&amp;mdash;venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, leaders of major companies, innovators in non-profit start-ups, scientists, and technologists. You will be inspired and challenged as you read their journeys of faith.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book provides lessons for anyone who has struggled with faith. You will read how these leaders got beyond the trappings of financial and business success to find God; how they overcame personal struggle and even tragedy to come to know Christ; how they reconciled reason and faith, and science and faith; and how they discovered meaning, purpose, and a calling for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book&amp;#39;s Foreword is written by Pat Gelsinger, CEO of VMware, a $6 billion company. Included in the book are stories of venture capital luminaries such as venture capitalists Kevin Compton and Promod Haque, and Google executive Kirk Perry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Following are endorsements for the book:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In a thought-provoking manner, Skip Vaccarello provides a collection of amazing stories of leaders who have found God in Silicon Valley...one of the most influential but anti-God places on earth...&amp;rdquo; Pat Gelsinger - VMware CEO&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For those curious about faith, I highly recommend that you read Finding God in Silicon Valley. It could change your life!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; ~ Brent Jones, former All-Pro SF 49er and Managing Director, Northgate Capital&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In Finding God in Silicon Valley, you will meet some great folks of faith.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; ~ Kevin Compton, Founder, Radar Partners, a venture capital firm&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Skip has skillfully woven together the captivating stories of influential men and women of the Silicon Valley, a place where you might not expect to find such vibrant followers of Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; ~ Chuck Bryant, CEO and Board Chair, Pinnacle Forum America, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a must read for business leaders, and beyond&amp;mdash;soak it in, learn, and be inspired! &amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt; ~ Bob Dees, Major General, U.S. Army, Retired&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These stories breathe humanity, wisdom, ethics, and even joy into a technological age in search of truth. A treasure of insight into what matters, and why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; ~ Kelly Monroe Kullberg, Finding God at Harvard, The Veritas Forum&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you are looking for inspiration and finding out what it takes to live a truly purpose-driven life, this book and these stories could change your life forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; ~ Tom Tognoli, CEO, Intero Real Estate, a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
