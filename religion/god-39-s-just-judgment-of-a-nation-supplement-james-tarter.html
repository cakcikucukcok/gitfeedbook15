  <title>God&#39;s Just Judgment of a Nation Supplement - James Tarter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection of 12 appendices and 4 chapter supplements to GOD&#39;S JUST JUDGMENT OF A NATION. I recommend this SUPPLEMENT or topics in it for those who have read or are reading that core book, although I make each discussion full enough to stand by itself. Here I call attention to Apx. 4, which shows God&#39;s justice to all and mercy to many in His way to judge nations generations after some sins.  Apx. 5 shows God&#39;s government of the earth from Mt. Zion, and shows requirements for believers in Jesus to participate in this government under King Jesus.  Apx. 7 offers unusual insights into God&#39;s amazing work to develop His fully Christ-like Church.  Apx. 12 provides beautiful insights into God&#39;s work to bring together the Church and Israel.  A reader of GOD&#39;S JUST JUDGMENT OF A NATION can check the free Preview of the SUPPLEMENT, which contains all of it, to see if other appendices and chapter supplements may help him/her.  Each has useful content for some believers." />
