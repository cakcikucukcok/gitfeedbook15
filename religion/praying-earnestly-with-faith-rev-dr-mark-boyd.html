  <title>Praying Earnestly with Faith - Rev. Dr. Mark Boyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written for all mankind in this universe to follow instructions from the first book that was set before us. Yes, that was the first true book, which was written for all men to follow, and that first book was called the Holy Bible, which is still the number one book in the entire world.
Basic things that were written from the Lord for all mankind to heed to and to follow all His
Instructions for all the human race to stay on the straight and narrow path without a stumble. But
Before His return to this wretched and cruel world, all of Gods people, we must get ready before
Leaving this ugly and sorrowful world, but there is something we must do before leaving this
Earth. 
We must clean up all the ugliness that is in our hearts and change our minds to a new way of thinking, and that is thinking with a pure mind and a pure heart, which is Christlike; any other way of thinking will not do. We must have an earnest heart to satisfy our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Because with an earnest heart, this book will show you how to get gratification in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and in yourself. You see, to know the Lord, you must pray with an earnest heart to get your prayers answered. So you see, when we learn from the Master, who is our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we get all kinds of excellent results. Let us take this scenario on what an earnest heart should be: when Jesus Christ prayed to His father, He prayed with an earnest heart, and that was why all of Jesus Christs prayers were answeredbecause He prayed with faith and an earnest heart." />
