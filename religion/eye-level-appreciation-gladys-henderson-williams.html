      <meta name="description" content="Appreciation, what is it?  Is it synonymous with wisdom?  Job 28:34 says, where is the place of wisdom, man knows not the place thereof could this be the same definition of appreciation?  Many of us have coined the clich I appreciate you  so what are we truly sayingumh! It causes one to think -- if Ive included this phrase in my list of clichs then I need to know what it really means when I use it.   The Webster Dictionary defines appreciation as  adding value. How would you define appreciation? Then, how do you add value to someone or something?  What are you bringing to the table that would add additional value to a person or event?  We make many statements that we have no application for.  How do we appreciate?  Is there a formula for appreciation?  Is it a desire, or is it something we say just to sound nice?  The questions are endless.  This book is not designed to be limited to only understanding appreciation, but also to trigger your thinking about quoting and re-quoting clichs that are never backed up with action.  There are several practical exercises included in this book that are designed to build your life in this area. Does the ability to appreciate at Eye-Level exist?  Are we appreciating at Eye-Level with future thoughts in mind?  What is the potential of the moment or event?  You cant add value for a future event without acknowledging the moment that currently exists.  Lets look further" />
