  <title>Frustrating God - Luis Scottt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever asked how Gods knowledge of the future impacts your life today? Frustrating God offers a challenge to the assumptions of open theism and provides answers that are both refreshing and new.
Theologians and laypeople alike have struggled with the extent Gods knowledge, the limitations of human free will, and the practical implications these ideas have for everyday life. Why doesnt God do something about all the evil in the world? Have you ever tried to answer the question about Gods goodness in light of the fact that people He created will be lost for all eternity? How can God answer prayers if He does not know and may not be able to anticipate the future consequences of those answers? How do we resolve the apparent conflict between human freedom and Gods overwhelming power? 
You can find the answer to these and many more questions in Frustrating God. 
In this challenge to the theological view of open theism, Pastor Luis Scott offers a radically new alternative to the seemingly tense relationship between Gods foreknowledge and human free will. This deepened understanding of Gods nature can enhance your perception of a God so magnificent that the only word to describe our struggle to know Him is frustrating. In Frustrating God you will begin a journey to a deeper knowledge of the mysterious God of the Biblethe God who baffles us, but loves us enough to lay the penalty of sin upon His beloved Son." />
