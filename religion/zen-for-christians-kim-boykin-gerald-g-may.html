  <title>Zen for Christians - Kim Boykin, Gerald G. May</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;Whereas other Christianity-meets-Buddhism books stress ideology and the intellect, this one emphasizes daily acts of practice.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; &lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/I&gt;(starred review)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; In this illuminating and insightful guide, Kim Boykin offers Christians a way to incorporate Zen practices into their lives without compromising their beliefs and faith.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;Zen for Christians&lt;/I&gt; assumes curiosity but no real knowledge as it walks readers through specific concepts of Zen philosophy &amp;mdash; including suffering, attachment, and enlightenment &amp;mdash; and explains each in a simple but lively way. Sections between chapters gently demonstrate Zen meditation practices, explaining the basics in a clear, engaging manner.&amp;nbsp;Placing Buddhist and Christian teachings side by side&amp;nbsp;helps readers not only understand Zen but also shows&amp;nbsp;their compatibility. Drawing on Dr. Boykin&amp;#39;s own personal search through Buddhism and Christianity as well as her background in theological studies, this thought-provoking work illustrates how Zen practice can be particularly useful for Christians who want to enrich their faith by incorporating contemplative practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;An excellent introduction to Zen &amp;mdash; clear and to the point, practical, respectful, and even humorous at times.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; &lt;I&gt;Yoga Journal &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;quot;Makes Zen practice more approachable and less esoteric &amp;hellip; a straightforward guide for those who want to try Zen for themselves.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; &lt;I&gt;Monastic Interreligious Dialogue Bulletin &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;quot;A trustworthy and delightful guide.

Kim Boykin&amp;#39;s book is a skillful step in that direction. The heart of the matter of Zen is presented in a direct and informative way that is based on her firsthand experience of Zen training.
