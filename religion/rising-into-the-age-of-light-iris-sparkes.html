  <title>Rising Into the Age of Light - Iris Sparkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book continues to explain to the reader the profound inner journey experienced by hundreds and hundreds of people who have continued to cross my path since the early years of the new millennium. It has been a journey that has enabled humanity alongside planet Earth to begin the rise to a higher level of consciousness. Following on from 20 years as a full-time mother with four children, Iris was well suited to becoming involved with the playgroup movement. This led her on to becoming manager of the local Citizens Advice Bureau. Separating from her husband and now living alone, it has become a very creative time. Coming from a musical background gave Iris the enthusiasm to learn to play, sing and compose for the Celtic harp. Natural healing abilities have now found expression as a Health Intuitive with many, many clients all over the country and abroad. Profound life experiences have encouraged Iris to express everything in words, from her first book, Caterpillar to Butterfly, published in 2009 followed by Over the Rainbow in 2012, Awakening to Love in 2014 and now Rising into the Age of Light." />
