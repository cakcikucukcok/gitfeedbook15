  <title>Believers but Strangers in the Eye&#39;s of God - Sharon D. Meadows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a modern world where Christianity is spoken of candidly, many profess the faith although their lifestyles contradict their belief. They are lukewarm in their actions and prefer to remain spiritually ignorant. Blinded by the pleasures of this world, they feed the flesh which ultimately corrupts the soul. They proclaim perfection is unreachable and God judges the heart, but his word says, Be perfect, therefore, as your father in heaven is perfect Matthew 5:48. For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander Matthew 15:19. We have been deceived by the enemy in believing there are no consequences for our sin. There are pastors who deny the existence of hell and promote heaven as a place we all will dwell. These lies are manipulations of the truth. They are for people who need encouragement to continue the road to destruction and for those enjoying a life of mediocrity with no accountability. This book is designed for a remnant of people who grieve over believers portraying a different walk than what they talk. It exposes hypocrisy, condemns the practice of falsehood, and reveals the truth which may be the ultimate savior of your soul!" />
