  <title>Who Is Satan, Where Did He Come From, and What Is His Purpose? - Minister Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By reading this book, you will find out that Satan is a deceiving spirit who hates God and the children of God. Satans objective is to lead you to unbelief and sin against God. Consider this: Satan is out to mar the human race.
He deceived Eve in the Garden of Eden to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil even when God informed her not to eat of it. Satan stood up against Israel and provoked King David to number Israel. Joshua was standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan was standing on the right hand to resist him. Satan entered Judas for him to betray the Lord Jesus.
Satan wants nothing to do with righteousness, and this is transparent. Satan wants us to go against God and betray one another. He does not want the lost to be saved. Satan will enable you to become remiss of every word of God, making them untrue and unnecessary. God wants to bless us in our everyday life, but Satan will block these blessings.
Satan is after our children, uncles, aunts, grandparents, parents, and you. We must continue to wear the whole armor of God to defeat him. For without the whole armor of God, Satan will be victorious. 
Scrutinize Satan." />
