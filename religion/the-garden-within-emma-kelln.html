  <title>The Garden Within - Emma Kelln</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to meet with God in the secret place of your soul? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To experience a face-to-face encounter with Him? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His heart meeting with yours? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a deep desire to be whole and free? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out your destiny in Him and for Him? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then join me in this journey to the Garden Within, a journey to wholeness. Jesus, the Master Gardener, absolutely knows what you were born for, because He created you for that purpose. He is perfecting you into His image. Before you were ever born, He knew you. He walked and talked with you in the very same garden you will enter on this journey. Will you let God, the pruner and gardener of your life, fashion you into His very image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINALLY. I received the revelation of how much God loves me. He grabbed my heart, my hand in The Garden Within. I have a whole new strength and outlook, and now I ache to be with Him. ~ Joni Patterson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hearts desire for you in this journey is for God Himself to touch and heal your soul, your very being, and for Him to bring restoration, purpose, and wholeness to your life. Through these pages He will reveal to you your restored, flourishing garden so that you can then nurture others and help them to grow and be fruitfulwith the ultimate goal being to fill the whole earth with the knowledge of God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here on this ground which is hard now, I will make it a vineyard. ~ Jesus&lt;/p&gt;" />
