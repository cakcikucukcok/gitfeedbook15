  <title>Afflictions of the Soul: Learning to Suffer Well - Dennis Newkirk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why is it that some Christians can handle even the most severe trials without losing their faith but others crumble and blame God? In Afflictions of the Soul, Pastor Dennis Newkirk counsels that those who crumble haven&amp;#39;t learned how to appropriate biblical truths and God&amp;#39;s power and promises in times of suffering. Many people think that once they&amp;#39;ve accepted Christ, life will be relatively pain-free. But the author, along with the Scriptures, eloquently conveys that this is simply not the case. The truth is, Christians and non-Christians alike will experience affliction because suffering is part of living in this fallen world. Newkirk writes not only as a compassionate pastor but also from personal experience, including stories of his own struggles with depression and cancer and his wife&amp;#39;s miraculous physical healing. In part 1, Newkirk presents five statements of biblical truths that can become the foundation for a theology for suffering well. In part 2, he examines some of our dysfunctional reactions to life&amp;#39;s problems and suffering-depression, fear, anxiety, and spiritual depression-and offers counsel based on Scripture, decades of helping others cope with these, and personal experience. Afflictions of the Soul will help believers apply the power and promises of God and even bring him glory through the suffering. His five anchors of biblical truths offer hope and help prepare us to suffer well, but always he points us to the Savior who sustains us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
