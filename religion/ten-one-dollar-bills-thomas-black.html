  <title>Ten One Dollar Bills - Thomas Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas Black&lt;/b&gt; is Vice President of Engineering at Fairfield Electric Cooperative in Blythewood, South Carolina. He is a member and deacon at Sandy Level Baptist Church in Blythewood. He is married to Cynthia, a wonderful wife of eighteen years, and stays busy raising two teenagers, Shelley and Jordan. In 2010, he served as the project coordinator for the Gavilan-Patastule Suspended Bridge near the town of Matiguas in Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas graduated from the University of South Carolina at Lancaster in 1989 with an Associate in Science, and from Clemson University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. He is a registered Professional Engineer with the state of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing two high school friends in 2009 would cause Thomas Black to reflect back not only on his childhood but on how short life really is. It would cause him to take a fresh look at his own life, at the accomplishments at his job, and ask himself a question: Is this it; is this all there is to lifemoney and daily routines? Then, as he sat at the computer late one night in March of 2010, searching his mind for answers, he fell into a deep sleep. When he awoke, somewhat startled, he quickly realized what had just happenedJesus had given him a life vision. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He prayed that night for God to give him another mountain to climb and a physical sign that he was being called out of the boat. The answers to those two questions came, with God not only showing him the mountain and the physical sign he had prayed for but taking him on a faith journey that would change his life forever. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in September, after venting in an e-mail to his pastor about his unanswered prayers for another church to become involved in the mission project and for the fundraising to end with a miracle that only God could do, God provided answers to both of those prayersthe next night! &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Thomas, 2010 would quickly become a spiritual marker. Ten One-Dollar Bills not only tells the story of this incredible journey but reminds us that life is a journey, not a destination, and as with any journey, serving the Lord + loving people = purpose. We are all challenged to get out of the boatmove beyond comfortlove without limitthat is where well discover not only who we truly are, but the bounty of Christ. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REVIEW: &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Read the book from cover to cover. An absolutely amazing and compelling story. The courage you have shown in your walk with the Lord is very inspiring to me. And when reading it, in between tears and joy, all I felt was Gods healing grace. Thank you so much.
