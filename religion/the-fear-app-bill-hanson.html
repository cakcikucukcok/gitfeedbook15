  <title>The Fear App - Bill Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you could discover a way to live your life without fear?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if a new vegetable that was just discovered could keep you from getting a deadly disease? Would you eat it? What if a new exercise developed would extend your life some twenty years? Would you try it? What if the information in The Fear App book would help you to remove those needless fears that run through our minds and keep us from following Gods will in our lives? Would you read it?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apps we have on our phones were developed to make a function or activity much easier or to assist us in some specific way. The Fear App book and the available study guide are similar dynamic tools. This book will help you identify the fears you may not even be aware of.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord has prepared ministry service for all of us to be involved in (Ephesians 2:10). If you allow fear to control service decisions, youll miss Gods best for your life and the blessings that come with following His will.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this book is written in such a way that its an easy read with a very practical approach, and it isnt too in depth or over the top; however, it gets right to the point of the fears all of us experience in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
