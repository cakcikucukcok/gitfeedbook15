  <title>A Layman’S Commentary Volume 3 - John Devine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays world, it can be difficult to maintain your faith. Those seeking a greater understanding of the Bible have numerous excellent theological commentaries available to them, but due to volume and depth, many of these are out of reach of laypeople. Others lose contact with the Bible because it no longer seems relevant to life. They use a superficial knowledge of science and evolution to exclude God and faith from their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Laymans Commentary: Volume 3Books of Wisdom&lt;/i&gt; presents a passage by passage explanation of the five Books of the Bible, known as Wisdom. In this third volume, author John Devine shows how these books address most of the issues of life from the existence of evil and suffering to the frustrations and futility of worldly philosophies. They give an understanding of existence and provide the path to a meaningful life. He explains Gods continued selfrevelation and plan for a relationship with humankind and considers the conflict and consequences of the desire of the individual to be independent from God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The third book in The Laymans Commentary series, Volume 3Books of Wisdom&lt;i&gt;shows that knowledge and experience from this period is still valid today, both the promises and the warnings, because Gods character has not changed  nor has the frailty of human nature. Devine draws out the practical application of these timeless truths as they relate to everyday experience and shows how they confirm that science and faith are complementary in an informed worldview. They include guidelines that enrich our personal relationship with God. &lt;/p&gt;" />
