  <title>Alive!  Reconnected &amp; Revived - Ursula Denise Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all have experienced times in our lives when it seems that God is Nowhere to be found. However, when we stop, refocus and reflect, we understand that God has been with us all along and presently is Now Here. As a traveler on an expedition looking for meaning and purpose, Ursula found this truth and she very methodically walks us through her steps of becoming Alive.  She shares her enlightened view as she turns to her Heavenly Father, time after time, encounter after encounter. 
This poetic anthology takes us full circle, from the point of the authors pangs of emotional death to recovery, to becoming completely revived.  She becomes Alive after recognizing and acknowledging The Gift that had been designated and reserved for her to deliver before the foundation of the world.  This gift, once opened and consumed, will release within each reader the sweet fragrance of love, joy, peace and happiness. 
It is with immense pleasure that I present to you, a book that will change your life. My prayer is that you take the time out for yourself, perhaps enjoy a refreshing cup of tea, and allow your imagination to take you on a journey that strikes a chord of familiarity as you reflect upon your own life and become
