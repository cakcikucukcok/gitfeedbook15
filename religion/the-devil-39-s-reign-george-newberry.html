  <title>The Devil&#39;s Reign - George Newberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Devils Reign is a true story.  Statements made by the author in this book have been validated with documentation and verified by this publisher&#39;s legal department.
You will read about a near-death experience, an ensuing mission to expose the forces of evil and warn people to get their lives in order with God, and mind-boggling events that followed.
George spent years writing a screenplay to relay his message, while being bombarded with problems, financial losses and shocking supernatural experiences. For example: The name Lucifer mysteriously appeared on a court document, baffling even the agencies involved. When numerology was done on the circumstance involving that name it equaled 666.
Many documented and witnessed supernatural occurrences followed. A priest told George, You have to finish your story or the Devil wins.
George finished his screenplay. But, he was still being watched by an evil eye. In 1998 a Hollywood Producer took $20,000 from him and destroyed his script. In 1999, over twenty scenes of Georges script appeared in the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, End of Days. The production company for that film was Lucifilms and the production start date wasNovember 21, 1998, Georges birthday.
George realized he was living the story he was to tell. He was in the midst of a battle between the forces of good and evil. His faith in the forces of good gave him the strength to confront the onslaught of evil, and he kept writing. He couldnt let the Devil win.  Regardless of religious beliefs, The Devils Reign is an inspiring book that will change peoples lives for the better.
The lamb never killed the lion. We cant conquer evil when we are bound by our own rules. We must fight evil with our enemys rules and with equal force or we will be destroyed." />
