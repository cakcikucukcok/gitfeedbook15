  <title>The Miracle Man - Jeff Kurtzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Miracle Man presents the spiritual autobiography of Jeff Kurtzer, a man who struggled with a series of challenges, including physical and mental abuse, early use of drugs and alcohol, a diagnosis of manic depression, and multiple stays in psychiatric care facilities. Born in Long Island, New York, the author lived through times that remind many of the life of Job, the biblical figure who endured extreme deprivation, but who clung to his faith in God. 
As he recounts the trajectory of his life, Jeff Kurtzer seasons his account with passage from the Scriptures that offered him encouragement at the time. His story was written to provide support to all who seek hope and change in their own lives. This approach flows from his faith that God sees the truth of ones life and will work to change it, just as he heard in a prophesy prayed over him: God has called you to His ministry and all you have been going through will be used to help many people. God is going to heal you completely and restore all that the enemy has stolen from you. 
When you face those moments in your lifewhether brief or extendedwhen the obstacles are piling up and all passages to peace seem hopelessly blocked, then The Miracle Man can offer you words of encouragement that God does still work miracles in todays world. He worked one in the life of Jeff Kurtzer, and He can work a miracle in your life too." />
