  <title>I Was There - Dr. Beverly J. Gaard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE TIME IS NOW! &lt;br /&gt;
After beginning this book thirty years ago, I realize now is the time people are ready for transformation and will accept learning about the miraculous life of my master teacher, Dr. DJ Bussell. What he did and the miracles he performed that seemed impossible are explained and taught in this book. &lt;br /&gt;
At the age of twenty-seven, I found Dr. Bussell, a teacher I had been searching for since I was a child. He answered all my questions and daily exemplified the philosophy of Chirothesia and the Universal Laws in action. I saw a woman healed of blindness, a man cured of epilepsy, a man who robbed a bank surrender himself, a man with a severed spinal cord walk, and I learned the secret teachings of the Essenes, authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls that were found in 1947. &lt;br /&gt;
The Law of Cause and Effect is in operation constantly, and the six Universal Laws that will transform your life are: the Law of Breath, the Law of Harmony, the Law of Abundance, the Law of Health, the Law of Right Action, and the Law of Protection. You will learn how to heal by Breath, settle arguments and transform situations by Harmony, be in expanding and fulfilling Abundance, always be in the right place at the right time with the right people in Right Action, and protect your home and loved ones by Protection. Everyone wants to be happy, healthy, secure, and loved. Knowing and practicing these Universal Laws daily will transform your life. It did, for everyone I met. I know. I was there." />
