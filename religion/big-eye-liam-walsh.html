  <title>Big Eye - Liam Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Big Eye: The Preacher brings to life the deep and resonant relationship of love that binds together Big Eye, God, and Little Man, author Liam Walsh, by sharing the dialogue that arises between these two figures. The back-and-forth conversation they share demonstrates the frank, open, and honest tie that binds the two together.
The second part of Big Eye: The Preacher presents a series of Golden Egg Meditations. These challenges, based on nuggets mined from the veins of Scripture and doctrine, present the treasures that Jesus offers. The author encourages readers to think of these reflections as eggs and to make nests in their minds through contemplation of the truths these eggs contains.
Big Eye: The Preacher is not a book for readers who want to sit back and let entertainment wash over them. Rather, it invites you to enter a period of intensive spiritual renewal. This promises to be a time energized by the conversation between Big Eye and Little Man and the inner dialogue that arises in you, the reader, through your encounter with both the truth of your own lifewhether you are Little Man or Little Womanand the reality of God, our Big Eye." />
