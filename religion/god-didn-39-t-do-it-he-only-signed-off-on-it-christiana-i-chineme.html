  <title>God Didn&#39;t Do It; He Only Signed off on It - Christiana I. Chineme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;As humans, things happen to us sometimes that we cannot fully understand. We desire to explain them when from human perspective there&#39;s no explanation that really exists. Our perplexion at things of that nature are not just about when they happen to us but also the things we witness in the world around us. They oftentimes shake the foundations of our faith in God to the core. But as much as not knowing hurts, at no time should our reaction be to accuse God for things we don&#39;t understand. Rather, we should know that God is not always the architect of all our problems and that He might not always save us from people that live to harm us or bless us the way we want because we take a stand with Him. His promise however is one thing and that is that He&#39;ll work it all out&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt; for HIS OWN ENDS even the wicked for a day of disaster&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/B&gt;Proverbs 16:4b. However your pain occurred, God&#39;s declared intentions are that He&#39;ll use all of your problems any which way they present to work out His will for your life. The deaths of some of the people that went before us is proof that for reasons best known to Him, God at times chooses not to deliver people that take a stand with Him. And it&#39;s not because He hated such people but because of what He already planned to use the situation for. &lt;/P&gt;
