  <title>Overcome All Obstacles - Andre Gilchrist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Overcome All Obstacles is the conclusion of the autobiography of Andre Gilchrist and covers the years 20052014. The first book, You Thought You Couldnt Change, Either, came out in February of 2006 and covered the life of Andre Gilchrist in a chronological order dating back from birth to 2005. Andre Gilchrists second novel, Out of the Darkness Comes the Light, came out in May of 2009. Due to the response from the authors first and second book, the author has decided to keep his reading audience up-to-date with what is going on in the here and now. 
In the authors first book, he described the journey of the individual who struggled within himself. The author takes the reader on a step-by-step journey from desperation to determination. In this book, the author reaches a stage in his life where he is comfortable with himself and his life but wants to point out that even at this point in ones life one still has to deal with the trials and tribulations of life. It is important to the author to stress the point that it is not necessary to regress in order to progress. 
With a firm grasp of reality today, and not what one might want it to be, the author wants to show his audience it is possible to deal with lifes situations one at a time and always keep up front in his mind that God will not put more on him that he can carry." />
