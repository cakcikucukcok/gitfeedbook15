Will Israel be destroyed by 2012-2016 A.D. and the land laid waste for many years until the end comes and Jesus returns in 2070-2075 A.D.?  Will people begin to say &quot;the lord delayeth his coming and where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue since creation?&quot;  The fathers, or old fathers, could be the dead TV preachers and Christian writers or the dead Jews in the war.
