  <title>The Depth of Faith - Jayamon Jacob</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ultimate goal of this book is to increase anyones faithlessness, weak faith, or little faith to a substantial gravity of mature and deep faith in Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, since true faith is the bridge between God and man. The Bible clearly spells out Jesus is the author and finisher of faith, and every believer in Him ought to follow His footsteps. While reading this book, a genuine transformation in your faith may take place, and you may feel the amount of faith slowly enhances and spiritual darkness gradually vanishes. Feel the light arrive which would eventually portray the bright and morning star, and it is nobody but Jesus Christ. He is the Bishop of all souls who knocks at every door to open and anyone opens by faith, He would dine with him or her, and that person would truly understand He is the author and finisher of your faith." />
