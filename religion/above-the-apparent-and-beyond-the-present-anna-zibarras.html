  <title>Above the Apparent  and  Beyond the Present - Anna Zibarras</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this  mundane, material, sensory   world  in which   pain, sadness, disappointments, failures, discontent,  depression, and  disharmony  are encountered daily,  we can  now embark, in this Book, on a   journey  through which   we are able to shape our own destiny  and  master our own  lives  in order to avoid suffering,  to gain  inner Peace,  to become compassionate, wise, happy and eventually  enlightened human beings,   by the grace of  God.
When we consciously become aware of the existence of God, we come to realize that God is the only reality of our being. This  realization has a transforming eff ect in our lives. It helps us create  a more harmonious self, a more harmonious family, and a more  harmonious society in which peace and joy prevail.  If we consciously believe that we come to this life with a purpose  and that our purpose is to serve humanity, to raise our consciousness,
and to receive the grace of God, we become connected to the  universal light, and through it, we can gain universal consciousness  of awareness.  If we have faith and if we let the grace infi ltrate our being, then  our life, through our relationship with God, becomes a state of bliss  and ecstasy." />
