  <title>Disorientations of Life - Kagiso Tlhopile</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine a life where you didnt have to go through anything, where you didnt have to worry or have struggles to overcome? Quiet lovely, isnt it? Though the next question would then be, will you still be able to call yourself a fighter, overcomer, and all these other courageous names we so often attach to our own character and often use to describe who we are in our essence?&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Not every bad thing in life ends up badly. Not every hopeless situation you find yourself in will end with you being even more hopeless or even suicidal. This book seeks to take you on a personal journey from wherever it is you find yourself at the moment to a place where you should be in order to experience the grace, love, and peace of God. This will surely surpass any situations you find yourself in and provide you the understanding of just how great, how awesome is this God that you serve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
