  <title>Prosperity: Is It by Law or Grace? - Stewart Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;From the beginning, God gave commandments and instructions throughout the Bible about avoiding debt, sowing into his kingdom, sustaining your body by treating it as a temple, and loving each other. In &lt;i&gt;Prosperity: Is it by Law or Grace?&lt;/i&gt;, author Stewart Robertson brings you back to the fundamentals of living life as the maker intended.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Robertson addresses the whole of mans spirit, soul (mind, will, and emotions), and physical body. This holistic approach increases the quality of your life and gives you assurance of knowing where youre going when you die. Through scripture, historical accounts, and personal observations, he shows how Christian blessings are based on grace, and he provides evidence of what God truly expects of you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Prosperity: Is it by Law or Grace? &lt;/i&gt;, Robertson describes the basic principles God has bestowed on you to simplify your journey on earth. By sustaining every portion given to you, you can prosper, adjust your way of thinking, and change your circumstances to become blessed and to be a blessing to others.&lt;/P&gt;" />
