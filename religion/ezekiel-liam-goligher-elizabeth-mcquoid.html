  <title>Ezekiel - Liam Goligher, Elizabeth McQuoid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel ben Buzi would never forget his 30th birthday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He had been trained as a priest and brought up to believe that at this age his life&#39;s work would begin. For years he had anticipated this moment when he would be ordained and eligible to serve in the temple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But instead of being in Jerusalem, he was a captive in Babylon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of being a priest, he was called by God to be a prophet. Instead of serving in the temple, he was surrounded by a plethora of pagan gods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on his 30th birthday, he received a vision from God... This timely vision confronted the Jews with their sinfulness and the necessity of divine judgement. It also reminded them of God&#39;s sovereignty and the promise of future restoration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our lives, like Ezekiel&#39;s, may have turned out differently from how we had expected they would. Can we keep on serving God in turbulent times, trusting God&#39;s sovereignty and striving for holiness with the Holy Spirit&#39;s help and power?&lt;/p&gt;" />
