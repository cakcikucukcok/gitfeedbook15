  <title>Prayers for Hard Times - Becca Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The simple act of praying&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wisdom, inspiration and prayer:&lt;/b&gt; As recent scientific research shows, the simple act of praying can be emotionally, spiritually, and even physically healing. With &lt;i&gt;Prayers for Hard Times&lt;/i&gt;, author Becca Anderson offers solace in bringing together the wisdom of great thinkers, spiritual leaders and writers who have faced difficulty and learned from it.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sacred and inspirational sources:&lt;/b&gt; Organized in daybook form, the book draws from sacred sources such as the Bible, the Torah, Buddhist and Native American texts, as well as inspirational writings of:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joan Didion
&lt;li&gt;Elizabeth Gilbert
&lt;li&gt;Maya Angelou
&lt;li&gt;Rumi
&lt;li&gt;Mark Nepo
&lt;li&gt;Harriet Tubman
&lt;li&gt;Dave Eggars
&lt;li&gt;Abraham Lincoln
&lt;li&gt;Anne Morrow Lindberg
&lt;li&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Consolation and renewal:&lt;/b&gt; Together, these wise words create a tapestry of consolation and renewal for those times when it all seems “too much.” In a world that feels increasingly fragile and, at times, fractured, people need answers and prayers.  Becca Anderson’s collection focuses on prayers for a wide range of life challenges, from the personal to the global. &lt;i&gt;Prayers for Hard Times&lt;/i&gt; covers issues facing individuals such as loss of loved ones, illness, anxiety, divorce, depression and addiction, as well as those challenges communities face in natural disasters and violence. The writers in Anderson’s devotional address the world at large, as well, with words of hope and help for global poverty, hunger, war and the environmental. &lt;i&gt;Prayers for Hard Times&lt;/i&gt; offers readers solace, comfort, and support, drawing from the wisdom of every era, every major faith and tradition, and the important voices of those who have lived through such experiences themselves." />
