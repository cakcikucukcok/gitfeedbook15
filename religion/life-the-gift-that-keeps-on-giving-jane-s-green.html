  <title>Life: the Gift That Keeps on Giving - Jane S. Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone has a story to tell, and I selected to tell my story through my blog formerly called: Monday Morning Bluees, which is an acronym for &quot;Believe Life Uses Everyone and Everything Spiritually.&quot; I have endured many hurts, mistakes, lessons, pains, failures, heartbreaks, disappointments, hardships, and struggles throughout my life, but I have also been on the receiving end of countless success stories, miracles, breakthroughs, victories, accomplishments, awards, accolades, and other blessings.  I have come to accept that life is filled with polarities, and I came to this time-space reality to experience All of life including both its ups and its downs, (mostly ups).  I am learning that I gain strength and momentum when I go through uncomfortable situations, circumstances, and experiences. Reflecting on my lifes story allows me an opportunity to release and heal my past. I now have a greater appreciation for where I have been, a warm acceptance and peace for where I am presently; and a clearer perspective on where I am going. My intention for this work is to shed light on issues that many females face and provide comfort in knowing that we are not alone on this journey I call Life." />
