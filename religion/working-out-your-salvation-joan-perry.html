  <title>Working out Your Salvation - Joan Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are the apple of Gods eye and have been given the power and
the weapons to use proactively, stopping the enemys attempts to
destroy you. Working out your salvation entails doing what Jesus
commanded you to do. Your salvation isnt just for your eternal destination;
it is also to save yourself from the attempts of your adversary the devil to
defeat you here in this life. You must continually put on the armour of
God and use your weapons of warfare daily.
If you get nothing into your heart and head, than just this; that in Gods
eyes you are the most valued and precious person and that His love, mercy,
amazing grace and His forgiveness are all yours to cherish all the days of
your life. If you can truly understand and believe this fact, then you will
be able to experience heaven on earth and victory over the power of sin.
Gods love is awesome. You can be set free." />
