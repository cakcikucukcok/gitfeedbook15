  <title>A Pocketful of Tao: Two Taoist Classics Complete In One Volume - Dwight Goddard, Henri Borel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Of the ancient Chinese Sage Laotzu, founder of Taoism, &quot;Father of Beat Zen&quot; Dwight Goddard writes, &quot;I want you to appreciate this wise and kindly old man, and come to love him. He was perhaps the first of scholars (6th century B.C.) to have a vision of spiritual reality, and he tried so hard to explain it to others, only, in the end, to wander away into the Great Unknown in pathetic discouragement...&quot; But his great work, the Tao Teh King (Tao Te Ching) lived beyond his personal disappearance to profoundly influence Chinese religion and cultural character. Through Taoism&#39;s marriage with Buddhism in the Chinese Cha&#39;n and Japanese Zen traditions, Laotzu&#39;s vision has imprinted the spiritual understanding and practice of the entire world. Bringing two classic interpretations of his work together in one slim, portable volume, A POCKETFUL OF TAO is the ultimate hip-pocket companion for modern travelers of the Watercourse Way." />
