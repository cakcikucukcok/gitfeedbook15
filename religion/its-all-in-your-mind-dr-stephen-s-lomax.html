  <title>Its All in Your Mind! - Dr. Stephen S. Lomax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHY INVEST IN READING THIS BOOK?&lt;br /&gt;
Every word written in this book was specifically chosen to make you better: A better spouse: a better sibling: better member, choir, deacon, preacher, etc; better professional and certainly a better child of God. You need to deal with this subject because it is the will of God for you to be the best you can be (which is one of the subtopics of the book). Reading this book will greatly enhance your thinking ability and convince you that you can be better: But not only can be better, you are better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, it will motivate you into acknowledging that You are what you are because of what you think you are. You achieve what you achieve because you think you can achieve. You fail what you fail because you think failure and thereby fail to plan. And failing to plan is planning to fail. It will increase your awareness, capability, and motivation to always think before you act. Also, it will teach you how to apply your new found capabilities, philosophies and ideologies to everyday life. There are ten great chapters to help you think like Christ and act like God. And nothing shall be impossible unto you.&lt;br /&gt;
