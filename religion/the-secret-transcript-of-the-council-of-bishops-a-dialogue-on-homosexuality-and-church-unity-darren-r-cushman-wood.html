  <title>The Secret Transcript of the Council of Bishops: A Dialogue on Homosexuality and Church Unity - Darren R. Cushman Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would Wesley say? United Methodists have always looked to their founder for an example or a quick quote to justify their actions. The Secret Transcript of the Council of Bishops takes the readers inside the debate over homosexuality and church unity with John Wesley as their guide. Homosexuality raises a host of related questions about the nature and mission of the church, the meaning of membership, and the role of the episcopacy. The Secret Transcript of the Council of Bishops explores what Wesley had to say that can show us a more loving way to move forward.   Written as a dialogue among a group of fictitious United Methodist bishops, The Secret Transcript of the Council of Bishops explores the real-life implications of homosexuality on church unity. Every perspective in this complex and contentious debate is examined and respected as the reader explores how God might be speaking to us through the insights of John Wesley." />
