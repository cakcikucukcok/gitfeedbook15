  <title>Blessed Be - Julia Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blessed Be, is a true story and Christian testimony of (Judy Ann) Julia Wells. Julia is a hard working wife, mother, and grandmother. She commutes eighty miles round trip to her job at a Gottschalk&#39;s Department Store, in Carson City, Nevada.
Her story begins with the introductionexplaining how Roger, her husband of 30 years, has been diagnosed with cancer, and how the Lord put it on Julia&#39;s heart to write this book. The story then reflects back to her childhood, and family background. It tells of a small girl&#39;s insecurities. Her story is one of abandonment, abuse, molestation and losses. This is a fast paced story that gives you reason to laugh while rubbing the tears from your eyes.
Julias story goes on to tell of her love for music, which gives her the courage to write to Elvis Presley about what is happening in her life. It tells how Elvis became personally involved. She explains how she continued to look for love and acceptance in all the wrong places. While looking for her father, or a father like image, the Lord was knocking on the door to her heart. It tells a common story of finding God, then taking Him for granted. Putting the Lord on a shelf like an old used Bible to collect dust and only praying, or asking, Why me? when problems occur in her life. 
When Julia learned that she was a co-dependent, and was fighting with depression, the Lord knocks her feet out from under her. That is when He spoke to her saying, I picked you up and I carried you. I am with you and I forgive you. The Lord continued to work miracles in Julia&#39;s life, by healing her of cancer. The Lord gave her the strength and faith to make it through four deaths in twenty-one days, while having oral surgery and living in a tent-trailer with no running water. If that wasn&#39;t enough, He sent a guardian angel to protect her from an impending auto accident and the blessings continued.
So many things happened in Julia&#39;s life that almost anyone can relate to some part of her stay. It&#39;s a must read for anyone who has suffered from childhood abuse, molestation, dependency or codependency. Julia is a member of Al-Anon; she has been an Al-Ateen sponsor. She has been a Sunday school teacher. Julia&#39;s greatest blessing is the love of her Father, God; and her family.
 This book has song lyrics and scriptures that work with her story or chapters. There are poems that Julia wrote during the times of which she&#39;s telling you about in her book. And of course there is that testimony and witness that her prayers will reach the people to whom the Lord has intended." />
