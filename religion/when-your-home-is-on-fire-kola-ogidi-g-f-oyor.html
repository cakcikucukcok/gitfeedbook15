  <title>When Your Home Is on Fire - Kola Ogidi, G.F. Oyor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The family is the basic building block of society. The family unit, though a small part, is a very important part of society. Good homes mean a good society, and the reverse is true in all cultures. This is why the health of the family is a matter of importance to all societies worldwide. Unfortunately, the family is the most endangered unit of modern society. It is assaulted by divorce, emptiness, poverty, and many other ills.
In this book, When Your Home is on Fire written by my son in the Lord, Pastor Kola Ogidi, the author shows us that there are many beautiful houses that do not contain beautiful homes. This, unfortunately, is the tragedy of the 21st Century civilized society. Having failed to build the home front, everything else that modern man has built is crumbling right before his eyes! Now, all right-thinking people worldwide are calling attention to the need to strengthen the family as a fundamental weapon towards the eradication of the various social and moral ills of todays society. That is where this book comes in.
Pastor Ogidi has, in this masterpiece, shed refreshing light on the marriage institu-tion. He has diagnosed the causes of fire in homes. Then he went ahead to proffer practic-al, time-tested solutions to myriad marital problems. In doing so, he did not resort to mere social or psychological counseling. His therapy for burning homes is deliberately biblical at the core. And I think this is the high point of the book, for the word of God is sure to prosper where all else has failed. The Bible says,
So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
 Isaiah 55:11  
That is why I recommend this book to all persons whose homes are presently under fire. Through this book, God shall surely deliver you. More importantly, everyone who desires a peaceful and joyful home should read this book. Prevention is better than cure. As you study this book and apply the lessons therein, your home shall never come under fire; rather it shall be heaven on earth in Jesus name (Amen).
God bless you." />
