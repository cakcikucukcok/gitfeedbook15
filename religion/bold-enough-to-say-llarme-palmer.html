  <title>Bold Enough to Say! - Llarme’ Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How could she say such a thing?
Abandonment issues?, been there.
Addictions?, Which ones?
Assaults?, what kind and by whom?
	This writing addresses topics  that are prevalent today which many would presume be forgotten.  (Bold Enough to Say) shows how Gods unconditional love can change any given situation in a world that is searching for answers.  Its not about religion, it is about a relationship with The Father.   Although some of the content in this writing is controversial, it speaks on behalf of the voiceless and speaks to those who have offended.  Will this message be received by all? Not likely, however; this read can be a tool for a journey of love, forgiveness, healing and deliverance.  It is for the elite as well as the impoverished.  No more silent tears!  With Gods leading, I have seen and I have heard.  I boldly declare, after this reading your life will never be the same.
Ephesians 6:19 (amplified version) &quot;And for me, that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel.&quot;" />
