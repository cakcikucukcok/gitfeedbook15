  <title>Peace &amp; Love - Leland Bedford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peace &amp; Love&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of truth like none before, and like none that will be after, truly one of a kind! The selections within are a reflection of thought that is like a seed to the brain of every man, woman, and child, to be watered by life, and grow into an existence where love is the end result of new found peace. The lie has no home with in the pages of this book, because the lie holds no truth, like a World created by God that holds no peace nor love. In time we live, and in time it is promised that we will forever be, so in time &lt;i&gt;Peace &amp; Love&lt;/i&gt; has been placed to collectively bring
them that are unconscious to a new consciousness of life, death, truth, lie, good, evil, victory, defeat, success, failure, hope, eternal hope, God, Jesus, and the Devil, you, me, and we. To all that search for understanding and are a student of inspiration, with in this book holds a gift of sincerity, with the purpose to build and destroy, to build a new idea that is the antithesis of all that has kept us in the dark, all that has kept us from one another, and destroy all that has shined light on that which we are not that has made are sunshine like Hells fire, rather than the warmth of Gods love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening this book will open your eyes, though you have never been blind, and will breath new air into the lungs that were given by the Father to live, like any food for nourishment the knowledge within can do no harm, only feed the soul. Like anything all may not see what is shown as one mans treasure, is another mans trash, but as trash is unwanted so is the absence of peace and love in a World were Christ is King, and we live, in search of life, life everlasting, this I believe is like motivation to grow with out digression and to digress through progression. Inspirational words, thoughts, and ideas live with in the pages of &lt;i&gt;Peace &amp; Love&lt;/i&gt;, thoughts of happiness and joy, pain and agony, victory and defeat, good and evil, God and the Devil, Heaven and Hell, hope and despair, with the purpose to discover truth that will bring clarity to the chaos which can cloud the mind, soul, spirit, and body of any man, woman, or child, letting all whom may journey through its pages know that all are apart of the collective conscious that defines who we are, and that we can only be we, if there is peace and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
