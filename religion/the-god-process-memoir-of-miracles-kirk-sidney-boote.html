  <title>The God Process: Memoir of Miracles - Kirk Sidney Boote</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THERE IS A MYSTERY &lt;/strong&gt;to life that compels us to look beyond time, in search of our eternity. It is in this search where we look for meaning, hope and the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; to life. When we look back on our life some memories will sparkle while others burn to become the fire of the soul&amp;mdash;life shapes us, molds us and forges us to become who we are. Over time we change and color is added to our soul.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If you do not believe in God, this book may cause you to rethink. If you do believe in God this book is not about religion, but rather how this reality of God surfaces in life. Regardless as to whether or not you believe in God, seeing what life does to you or to others compels us to see life differently.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Although I am Christian, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The God Process&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is not just about Christianity. God did not have us all born into&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Christianity. Yet,&amp;nbsp;my encounter with God was through my Christianity. My story of family and life I hope transcends all faiths. In the exploration of faith, even atheism, we discover the roots of our soul. In faith we discover that part of us that brings meaning to the self and meaning to life. In that discovery lies our potential.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In the playground of life we explore what we cannot see. Behind the vale lies the great mystery of why we are here.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A miracle can change you.&amp;nbsp; A miracle can open your soul.&amp;nbsp; A miracle causes you to stop and to see life differently.&amp;nbsp; This book will take you on a journey of miracles and how miracles shape life.&amp;nbsp; Seeing what lies behind the vale&amp;nbsp;to find&amp;nbsp;our eternity is the journey we are all on.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kirk S.
