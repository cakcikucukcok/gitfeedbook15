  <title>In Defense of Lifting up Jesus: Will You Stand in the Gap with Me? - Wanda Treadway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe that readers will be interested in my unique voice as an author because I will be honest and straight forward about the topics I write and I will not confuse the readers with half truths and say one thing and something entirely different. Furthermore, my goal is to make readers feel as if they know as a friend and someone they can relates especially as it relates to topics that fuel their interests. But of importance to me, is that they can feel my passion and energy writings.
The main point i want to get across to reaers, is that society at large and including the church, they should stop making Jesus a scapegoat for all society&#39;s ills today. More importantly, I want readers to understand what Jesus stood for 2,000 years ago, He stands for today, and that to do what is best for humanity, so that they have a favorable outcome in this life and beyond." />
