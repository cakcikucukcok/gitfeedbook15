  <title>The Tyranny of the Trinity - P.R. Lackey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For 1700 years the Trinity has been considered the cornerstone of Christianity by all mainstream churches.  But the Bibles words for God, appearing thousands of times, never mean a triune God.  The concept of the Trinity has been taught to churchgoers based solely on implication and inference.  The truth is, the Scriptures dont support the doctrine of the Trinity, but it has been indoctrinated into the minds of otherwise intelligent and well-educated Christians and perpetuated as a mystery not meant to be understood.  The majority of Christians have not bothered to investigate the doctrine for themselves, and consequently have been duped.  Ms. Lackey suggests that far too many Christians attend church with the attitude: Tell me, pastor, what do I believe today?
Ms. Lackey expressed her resentment at being accused of being a heretic, not being a Christian, and being condemned to hell because of her strong belief in the  human Jesus, the Messiah and Son of God, as opposed to being the one Almighty God. Her strong conviction led her to collaborate with biblical Unitarian authors to create a book that challenges the centuries-old man-made doctrines of the Trinity,  the mainstay of ecclesiastical tradition.  Ms. Lackey sees the Trinity as blight on the true Christianity taught by Jesus Christ for the benefit of humanity and feels Trinitarian Christians have traded Hebrew theology for Geek mythology with barely a question asked.  She further contends that the  majority of Christians  believe in the Trinity primarily because they are expected to!  Not to accept this dogma would place them under condemnation from both their brethren and the clergy.  Ms. Lackey invites churchgoers everywhere to consider that they may have been drawn into a thinly veiled polytheism  a belief in more than one God. She adamantly contends that Christians must take more responsibility for their beliefs and stop settling for centuries-old, creeds and doctrines as scriptural truth!    
The cover illustration depicts the agony experienced by Michael Servetus, a brilliant Spanish physician and theologian, who as one of the first Protestants to challenge the Trinity, was slowly burned at the stake in 1553, his book fastened to his thigh, at the instigation of the Protestant reformer John Calvin." />
