  <title>How I Dealt with Cancer in a Non-Conventional Way - Gloria Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More and more of us are being diagnosed with cancer, which seems to affect every part of the body. For years, the only way of treating this disease was through chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, which are termed as conventional treatment. 
Lately, the nonconventional way of taking care of our bodies and making decisions about the treatment is taking a foothold. In her book How I Dealt with Cancer in a Non-Conventional Way, Gloria Austin introduces you to another way of dealing with the diagnosis of cancer other than the conventional way. This way is not harmful to the body. 
How I Dealt with Cancer in a Non-Conventional Way is a guide that shows you how to take control of your own health and well-being. Youll learn about your wonderfully made body, which was made to heal itself. Youll see that what you eat and how much you move your body affects your health, as do your thoughts and beliefs. 
Youll learn about some of the weapons and ammunition that you can use in the war against any type of cancer. Some of these are in your kitchen cupboard, and others you can grow yourself. Encouragement is provided in the form of hope, trust, faith, and courage in your choice of going the nonconventional way as you journey towards a cancer-free body." />
