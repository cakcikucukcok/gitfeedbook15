  <title>Directions for Daily Holy Living - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Daniel Burgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daniel Burgess (1645-1713) was a popular Reformed, Presbyterian minister, and a fiery preacher in his day.  The Christian cannot check off a list a number of items to be better in prayer, bible study, worship, or any other spiritual discipline. Burgess will show that in spiritual duties all of them are a matter of the heart and of the head. The Christian can&#39;t check off, &quot;get your heart right before God,&quot; or, &quot;make your mind more consecrated to God in the morning.&quot; They can&#39;t check off, &quot;improve your use of the holy sacrament of the Lord&#39;s Supper,&quot; or, &quot;receive the faithful minister&#39;s words when he preaches as God&#39;s own words.&quot; These are issues of the heart, salvation, regeneration, and being a Christian. Burgess shows how to take these &quot;holy directions&quot; and think rightly about them in applying them in their everyday life.   This work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions." />
