  <title>25 Icons of Peace in the Qur&#39;an - Mary Saad Assel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The prophets in the Quran condemn war, hatred, and disparity and advocate the belief in Gods oneness and His call for peace among mankind.  Assel successfully captures the minds of readers by giving them the opportunity to analyze and compare the stories of the prophets in the Quran with those of the prophets from the Old and New Testaments.  She brings together the validated interpretations of both Sunni and Shia schools of thought in order to sustain objectivity and allow room for comparison and interpretation. &lt;p&gt; 
Islam is an important force of solidarity and unity among mankind.  It is the ultimate triumph to Muslims who perceive it to be the final test to a peace-seeking democratic society that denounces the dominant forces that are conspiring against it.  This book is a valuable reference and text for students, professionals, scholars, and all who are interested in learning about Islam without having to read the entire Quran.  It brings to the forefront the belief that Islam is truly a religion of peace.  It was the death of her thirty-three year old son, Mazen, and her search for spiritual and emotional peace that inspired her to write this book." />
