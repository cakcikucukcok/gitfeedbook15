  <title>Forgiveness - Dr. George W. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the greatest struggles we have in our lives is not only forgiving other people but knowing what to do when we do not receive forgiveness from them. In this book, our whole desire is to not only define what true forgiveness is but to understand how we can forgive someone who has done something that initially seems to be unforgiveable. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What does true forgiveness look like? Is there a transgression that I do not have to forgive? Does my forgiving someone depend upon the degree of sorrow they demonstrate for what they have done, or must I forgive them anyway? Do I have to forget what a person has done to me in order to truly forgive them? These and many other questions will be addressed in the pages of this book. Forgiveness is our greatest need and the greatest gift we can receive and give to others." />
