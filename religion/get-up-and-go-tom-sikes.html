  <title>Get up and Go! - Tom Sikes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Get Up and Go!Devotionals for Mission&lt;/I&gt; offers itself to the reader as a companion for the journey that follows Jesus into mission in daily life. Tom Sikes, author and pastor, presents brief devotions, where each reflection builds upon the foundation of a passage from the Bible and leads to a prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Get Up and Go!&lt;/I&gt; groups its devotions into two sections: Get Up and Go with Jesus and Get Up and Go with the Disciples. Within these two sections, individual devotions embrace a variety of topics with titles like Mission Possible, The Swoosh, Feeling Small, Man Cave, Weve Got Spirit, and Get the Bagpiper. One final section, Get Up and Go with Us, presents a short compendium of suggestions for sources of inspiration for growth in ones discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have recollections of hearing and reading Bible stories and finding yourself wondering how the followers of Jesus made such drastic changes in their lives and set out with such fervor to carry out his mission. If you do, then &lt;I&gt;Get Up and Go!Devotionals for Mission&lt;/I&gt; will serve as your devotional guide for returning to Jesus and his disciples for inspiration and for answering his call to get up and go out into the worldto carry out his mission and share the good news.&lt;/p&gt;" />
