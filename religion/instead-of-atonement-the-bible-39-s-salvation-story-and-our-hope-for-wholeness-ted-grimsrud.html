  <title>Instead of Atonement: The Bible&#39;s Salvation Story and Our Hope for Wholeness - Ted Grimsrud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do atonement theologies that focus on Jesus&#39; death underwrite human violence? If so, we do well to rethink beliefs that this death is necessary to bring salvation. Focusing on the Bible&#39;s salvation story, Instead of Atonement argues for a logic of mercy to replace Christianity&#39;s traditional logic of retribution.  The book traces the Bible&#39;s main salvation story through God&#39;s liberating acts, the testimony of the prophets, and Jesus&#39;s life and teaching. It then takes a closer look at Jesus&#39;s death and argues that his death gains its meaning when it exposes violence in the cultural, religious, and political Powers. God&#39;s raising of Jesus completes the story and vindicates Jesus&#39;s life and teaching.  The book also examines the understandings of salvation in Romans and Revelation that reinforce the message that salvation is a gift of God and that Jesus&#39;s work has to do with his faithful life, his resistance to the Powers, and God&#39;s vindication of him through resurrection.  The book concludes that the Bible&#39;s salvation story provides a different way, instead of atonement, to understand salvation. In turn, this biblical understanding gives us today theological resources for a mercy-oriented approach to responding to wrongdoing, one that follows God&#39;s own model." />
