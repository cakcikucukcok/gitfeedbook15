  <title>Tempting the Player - Kat Latham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Libby Hart and Matt Ogden are perfect for each other&amp;#151;as friends. They&amp;#39;ve known each other for ages. They act as each other&amp;#39;s plus-ones. They even share custody of a dog. And if there&amp;#39;s always been a little spark between them, so what? It&amp;#39;s never been worth jeopardizing their friendship.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Professional rugby player Matt is fighting for a starter position with the London Legends&amp;#151;and that&amp;#39;s not the only thing he&amp;#39;s fighting. A crippling fear of flying means he&amp;#39;s struggling to get his career off the ground. He has no time for a relationship, even if Libby does make him ache. As an airline pilot, Libby&amp;#39;s looking for a stay-at-home husband so she can have a family without sacrificing her high-flying career. Matt&amp;#39;s certainly not that man.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;But just because they don&amp;#39;t have a future together doesn&amp;#39;t mean they can&amp;#39;t have a right now. When Matt asks Libby for help overcoming his fear, they agree to take a vacation from their platonic relationship&amp;#151;whenever they fly together, they can have sex. It&amp;#39;s the perfect way to resolve all that built-up tension. As long as they can avoid getting a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; comfortable&amp;#133;" />
