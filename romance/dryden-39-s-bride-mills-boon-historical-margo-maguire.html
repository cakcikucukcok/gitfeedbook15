  <title>Dryden&#39;s Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Historical) - Margo Maguire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Sir Hugh Dryden undertook his quest for a bride with a guarded heart. But two years of captivity had deadened his desire for any woman. So why, then, did the sight of a mere country girl in distress stir such tenderness in him? And why did simply carrying her from danger set his pulse pounding?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Without a proper dowry, no gentleman would ask to marry Sian Tudor. Most made less respectable offers–excepting the knight who&#39;d rescued her from certain death. The man was strong and dangerous looking–and she&#39;d had the most unfamiliar longing to touch him. But what sense were flights of fancy when he was surely bound for battle–and Sian about to be banished to a nunnery…?&lt;/p&gt;
