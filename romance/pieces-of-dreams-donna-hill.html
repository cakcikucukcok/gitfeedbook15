For as long as Maxine could remember, her nights were filled with dreams of his return. That was then. Now Quinn is back after another tragedy occurs in his life, and he wants things the way they were. But Maxine has a new life, a new man&amp;hellip;and a secret that binds her and Quinn forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Common sense tells Maxine she shouldn&#39;t put her heart in the hands of the man who once left it broken in pieces&amp;mdash;and risk losing the love and devotion of Taylor Collins, who not only brings her joy, but the kind of love she always longed for. Is Taylor her real love or a substitute for what she lost? As Maxine struggles against Quinn&#39;s passionate pleas, and the old desires ignite between them, she must decide if what they have is strong enough to last this time, or if her feelings are only&amp;hellip;pieces of dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
