  <title>A Family&#39;s Nightmare - Celena Wyndemere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
This book is a story of a young mother and her eighteen year old twins who are abducted and forced into doing things that are against their morals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;#39;t stand by and watch this anymore. My boss is out of control. I&amp;#39;ve never seen him like this before. In those bags over there are two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for each of you. You have to be starving. There&amp;#39;s also some water for you to drink, as well as extra for you to clean yourselves up a little. I brought some soap and washcloths too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lucille asked, &amp;quot;Why are you helping us? What do you want?&amp;quot; His answer was, &amp;quot;A couple things Ms. Watson. I figure there&amp;#39;s a small chance that you&amp;#39;ll get out of here, and you&amp;#39;ll go to the police. I&amp;#39;ll be glad to flip on the other three and testify against them if you&amp;#39;ll put in a good word for me to the D.A.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She responded, &amp;quot;You said &amp;#39;the other three&amp;#39;. That means that there&amp;#39;s another person involved. Who is it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m afraid I can&amp;#39;t answer that question. It would probably cost me my life.&amp;quot; She then asked, &amp;quot;You want something else. What is it? You must want something from me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry to do this after all you&amp;#39;ve been through, but so that I have a guarantee from you that you&amp;#39;ll help me out with the authorities, I have to ask you to let me some pussy. Just simple, slow, missionary sex. I&amp;#39;ll even wear a condom.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mr...I don&amp;#39;t know your name.&amp;quot; He said, &amp;quot;Allen ma&amp;#39;am. My name is Allen Dupree.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well Allen Dupree, you&amp;#39;re risking a lot just by being here. Of course I&amp;#39;ll help you out with the authorities. As for the other...&amp;quot; She lay back down on the mattress and spread her legs. Luci and Jimmy were flabbergasted. They both got up and walked to the other side of the room and faced the wall. Then they heard their mother say, &amp;quot;Mr. Dupree, let&amp;#39;s get this over with.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Allen got undressed and put the condom on his penis. So far, Lucille had only seen three in her entire life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This fourth one was the ugliest, most crooked thing she&amp;#39;d ever seen. &amp;quot;This won&amp;#39;t take long&amp;quot;, she thought to herself." />
