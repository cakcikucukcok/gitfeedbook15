  <title>Savage Betrayal - Shelli Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Agent Grace Masterson has been on leave after a mission went very wrong. She&#39;s part shifter, so harder to kill than a regular human, and she came close to being retired from action indefinitely. She doesn&#39;t need one of her big and broody fellow agents showing up to check on her. And she definitely doesn&#39;t need the unexpected and unwanted jolt of desire that hits her when she sees him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darrius Hilliard knows what Grace needs, and it&#39;s not people walking on eggshells around her. She needs someone to give her that push. When it seems there&#39;s someone who doesn&#39;t want her to return to active duty, Darrius is right there to have her back--and every other part of her. When their connection turns from teammate to mate, keeping Grace safe becomes more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Savage series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Savage Hunger&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Savage Betrayal&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Savage Revenge&lt;/p&gt;" />
