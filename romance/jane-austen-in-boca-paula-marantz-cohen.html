  <title>Jane Austen in Boca - Paula Marantz Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is a truth universally acknowledged that a nice Jewish widower must be in want of a wife.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Austen centered her classic novels of manners around &quot;three or four families in a country village.&quot;  So does Paula Marantz Cohen in her novel, a witty twist on Pride and Prejudice--except this time, the &quot;village&quot; is Boca Raton, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligible men, especially ones in possession of a good fortune and country club privileges, are scarce.  When goodhearted meddler Carol Newman learns that the wealthy Norman Grafstein has lost his wife, she resolves to marry&lt;br&gt;him off to her lonely mother-in-law, May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel charts the progress of May&#39;s love life as well as that of her two closest friends: the strong-minded former librarian Flo Kliman and the flamboyant Lila Katz. If there weren&#39;t confusion enough, Flo&#39;s great-niece Amy, a film student at NYU, suddenly arrives with a camera crew determined to get it all on tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will May and Norman eventually find happiness? Will Flo succumb to the charms of the suavely cosmopolitan Mel Shirmer? Will Amy&#39;s movie about them win an Academy Award--or at least a prize at the NYU student film competition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications and misunderstandings abound in this romantic and perceptive comedy of manners.&lt;/p&gt;" />
