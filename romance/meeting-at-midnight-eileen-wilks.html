  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Meeting at Midnight - Eileen Wilks</i></b> | Meeting at Midnight threw me off a bit since it's written in first person POV, which I wasn't expecting and it has some psychic/healing stuff thrown in. It's the story of the eldest McClain sibling Ben, who's been in charge ever since his parents died and recently he lost the idea he had of a family, when his newly discovered son's mother fell for his brother.<br /><b><i>Meeting at Midnight (At Midnight, #3) by Eileen Wilks</i></b> | MEETING AT MIDNIGHT is an exceptionally unusual story for a category line, and perhaps not what readers are expecting. But I found it powerful, compelling and very-well written . . . a book I couldn't put down! Kudos to Eileen for taking the risk of writing in first-person for this new ManTalk venture, and for pulling it off in such excellent style!<br /><b><i>Meeting At Midnight (Mantalk): Wilks, Eileen ...</i></b> | Meeting at Midnight (Mantalk Book 1605) - Kindle edition by Eileen Wilks. Download it once and read it on your Kindle device, PC, phones or tablets.
