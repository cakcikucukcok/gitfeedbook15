  <title>Mama Sutra - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Valentina Belmonte is one of the most beautiful movie stars in America, with a sex drive to match her gorgeous body. But her son Bobby is a dud in bed, unable to satisfy his girlfriends. When Valentina finds out his problem, she&amp;#39;s willing to give him a helping hand. But what happens when lessons in love turn hot and heavy, and desire pushes them into the world of taboo love?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not...not downstairs?&amp;quot; he asked, as she took him by the hand and led him into her bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re both going to be lying down, mijito,&amp;quot; she said gently. &amp;quot;Or, at least, I hope we are. There&amp;#39;s not enough room on the couches. And I&amp;#39;m not going to do it lying on the floor. Even if it&amp;#39;s got a nice, deep carpet. A bed is better.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But...your bed?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Would it make any difference if it was yours? Or Lorelei&amp;#39;s? Besides, I&amp;#39;ve got the biggest bed in the house.&amp;quot; A touch on his back, and she was guiding him through the upstairs hall. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all going to work out the same way in the end.&amp;quot; She peered up at him quizzically. &amp;quot;Does it matter that much?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;quot; he admitted, halting just inside her bedroom. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s like...I&amp;#39;m pretending to be someone I&amp;#39;m not.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;My lover? My husband?&amp;quot; She smiled at him. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not, and I don&amp;#39;t care. I&amp;#39;m just helping you out with your problem. Don&amp;#39;t worry about it. Now,&amp;quot; she added, pointing at the huge bed. &amp;quot;Get ready.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feeling a little bit...no. Scratch that. Feeling a lot weird, he stripped off his clothes and climbed onto the bed. On the other side, his mother disrobed with calm efficiency and lay down beside him. It was hard to watch her join him without feeling as if he were ogling her magnificent body, like some of the creeps who hung around the front gate before the cops ran them off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If she noticed his discomfort, she didn&amp;#39;t mention it. She lay down beside him, lying on her side. Her instep slowly ran up from his foot to his knee and back down again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How...how do you want to do this?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She smiled up at him. &amp;quot;Slowly.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He swallowed. &amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Relax, mijito.&amp;quot; She put a hand on his thigh, shaking her head when he twitched. &amp;quot;Honestly. It&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;ve never been in bed with a naked woman before.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never been in bed with my naked mother before,&amp;quot; he retorted." />
