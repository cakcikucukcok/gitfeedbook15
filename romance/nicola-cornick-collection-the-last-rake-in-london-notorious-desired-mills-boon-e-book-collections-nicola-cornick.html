          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Dauntsey Park: The Last Rake in London If you liked Downton Abbey, you&#39;ll love this book! Lady Ottoline cordially invites you to the party of the season… &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If ever a man had been born to cause a scandal over a woman, Jack Kestrel was that man. Last in a long line of dukes, his blue blood and undoubted charm mean his reputation can withstand any indignity. Whereas Sally Bowes’ divorce has already ruined her good reputation. And now her sister is causing an outrage, eloping with Jack’s cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enough is enough, and even Jack knows that they will have to put a stop to it. Despite being full of good intentions not to make waves at a country house party, Jack can’t resist the incomparable Sally, whose diamonds rival the flicker of Dauntsey’s chandeliers. And, as Lady Ottoline says, ‘sometimes it is more fun to be scandalous’. But what will the servants think?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Notorious Teresa, Dowager Marchioness of Darent, is rumoured to have exhausted her four deceased husbands with her insatiable needs.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s no surprise that every rake in the ton lusts after her. If they only knew…through clever marriages to men who would ask nothing of her physical self, Tessa has remained rather innocent in the ways of the bedroom. But now she&#39;s on the verge of losing everything and wants to take care of the stepson she&#39;s grown to adore. Enter Captain Owen Purchase. The handsome American adventurer has come into the title of Viscount Rothbury. And the rumours surrounding his injuries at sea suggest that he could fit Tessa&#39;s requirements. But little does Tessa realize that the gossipmongers are wrong. She just might lose her heart, and her desires, to the most unlikely of men…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Desired Dangerously seductive and sinfully beautiful, Susanna Burney is society’s most sought after matchbreaker.&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Paid by wealthy parents to part unsuitable couples, she’s never yet failed to accomplish her mission of diverting a groom-to-be. Until her final assignment brings her face-to-face with the man who’d once taught her an intimate lesson in heartache…. James Devlin has everything he&#39;s always wanted: a title, a rich fiancée and a place in society. But the woman who&#39;s just met his eyes across a crowded ballroom threatens it all. Not because she&#39;d once claimed his heart but because the secrets she carries could cost him everything. To put the past to rest once and for all, Dev just might have to play Susanna at her own wicked game. Let the scandal of the season begin…&lt;/p&gt;
