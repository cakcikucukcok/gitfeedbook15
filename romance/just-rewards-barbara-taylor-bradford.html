  <title>Just Rewards - Barbara Taylor Bradford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the blockbuster bestselling author comes the dramatic conclusion to the saga that began with Emma Harte and &lt;i&gt;A Woman of Substance&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four women at a crossroads. A family in crisis. And an enemy planning for his long-awaited chance at revenge. Who will have their &lt;i&gt;Just Rewards&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;Linnet O&#39;Neill, great-granddaughter of Emma Harte, finds herself following in the footsteps of the original woman of substance as she battles to modernize the family business. Returning from her honeymoon full of fresh ideas for bringing the Harte empire into the new century, Linnet locks horns with her mother, Paula, in a battle about the future. But due to unexpected circumstances, Linnet finds herself alone at the helm, just as her great-grandmother once was. Tessa Fairley is ready to start a new life after an acrimonious divorce--which might include rivaling her sister Linnet for the top spot in the Harte business. India Standish, in the midst of planning her own glamorous summer wedding in Ireland, is thrown off balance when her fiance&#39;s daughter Atlanta comes to live with them--closely followed by his unstable ex-girlfriend, intent on trouble. And Evan Hughes, their American cousin, unwittingly brings an enemy into their midst. But Evan&#39;s sister Angharad, who tries to infiltrate the quartet of young women, meets Jonathan Ainsley, the deadly enemy of the Hartes. Together, they spin a web of vengeance whereby no Harte is safe. &lt;i&gt;Just Rewards&lt;/i&gt; brings the story of Emma Harte and &lt;i&gt;A Woman of Substance &lt;/i&gt;full circle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
