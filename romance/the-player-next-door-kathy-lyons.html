  <title>The Player Next Door - Kathy Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;NBA star Mike Giamaria won&#39;t risk his career by playing with love. Ever. But when his cute, quirky, brainiac of a new neighbor falls off her death trap of a roof into his arms, Mike knows he&#39;s caught a heap of trouble...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble sums up Tori&#39;s life. Despite her academic success, no one believes she can take care of herself--not her family, not her ex-boyfriend. She&#39;s determined to live her life on her own terms, and if that includes a hot summer fling with the super-sexy athlete next door, so much the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Tori around, Mike can&#39;t keep his mind on basketball. He wants...&lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;. And to his horror, not just more time on the court. But when he puts the game ahead of the girl, he&#39;ll have to hit the biggest shot of his life to win her back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
