  <title>Kelly&#39;s Forbidden Love - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kelly is a 43-year-old widow frustrated with the men she&amp;#39;s dating. With thoughts of seducing Ryan, her son, consuming her mind, Kelly calls her best friend, asking Tiff to teach her how to be an escort. Tiff writes an ad for Kelly and posts it on a popular escort site, and over the next two days, Kelly has sex with 8 young men, hoping the experience will bury her carnal thoughts about Ryan. The problem is, It doesn&amp;#39;t help and she gives in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hi, mom. How was the date?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Morning, Ryan. There won&amp;rsquo;t be a second.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That bad, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep. Promise you won&amp;rsquo;t mature into an asshole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Never happen, you and dad raised me right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s my special, boy,&amp;rdquo; Kelly said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Boy? Mom, I&amp;rsquo;m twenty-two &amp;hellip; even slept with a few girls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sorry, son. I know you had to grow up fast when your dad died. You are a man, and a good one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thanks, mom. I try to be like dad every day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kelly stepped back, not noticing the silk robe popping open, exposing a good deal of her breasts. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re so much like him &amp;hellip; in every way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ryan&amp;rsquo;s eyes locked on his mom&amp;rsquo;s soft curves, unable to look away. &amp;ldquo;Uh, mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; Kelly followed his gaze and gasped, &amp;ldquo;Shit. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. Didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to flash you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know, mom. Don&amp;rsquo;t be embarrassed &amp;hellip; I think they look perfect. Girls half your age would kill for &amp;lsquo;em.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You just made my day, honey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kelly hugged Ryan again and felt his massive erection brushing against her, his hands lingering near the top of her ass longer than they should. Finally, Ryan pushed her away, counting the tiles on the floor. &amp;ldquo;Sorry, mom. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help it. You&amp;rsquo;re fucking beautiful.&amp;rdquo;" />
