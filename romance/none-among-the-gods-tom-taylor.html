  <title>None Among the Gods - Tom Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Did the Lord arrange this-or the devil?&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The heart of Pastor David Campbell churns with this question when, standing in the misty rain on a jungle airstrip in Paraguay, he sees her-from his years past. What is she doing here? He never dreamed he would ever see her again. &lt;/P&gt;
David had just come from America where, normally, a life of devotion to Jesus Christ would bring fulfillment and peace. But he has discovered living such a life in today&#39;s America can instead bring tragic legal and personal consequences. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is a crushed and discouraged pastor who finds himself on a strangely wondrous trip to an exotic land. How could he know that here he would find healing and heroism; and a love he thought he would never know again? &lt;/P&gt;" />
