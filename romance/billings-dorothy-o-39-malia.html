  <title>Billings - Dorothy O&#39;Malia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story starts out in St. Louis in 1868 with Peter Langerman, an Ex-Confederate soldier leaning on the rail of the steam-wheeler reflecting on his gracious southern lifestyle in Waycross, Georgia. The grandson of a prominent merchandiser, he knew on his release from the Yankee prison that he could not go back home to a war torn South. &lt;P&gt;
&quot;BILLINGS&quot; is a historical, romantic drama that takes place just after the Civil War.  It was during that time when the young and adventurous looked to the West for more opportunity and a better way of life.  Its about how Billings, Montana was born, the first settlers, their ambitions, hard work, loves, wins, losses and terrible political fights for power and how Billings opened the west for shipping cattle and grain east.&lt;P&gt;
&quot;PEGGY&quot;, the sequel to BILLINGS, is about the granddaughter of Henry Reiner who continues the story from 1916 through World War II with the third generation grandchildren of Peter Langerman.  We meet Ed and Judy MacFarland, the children of Millicent (Langerman) and Frank MacFarland as well as Bill Callahan the son of Mike and grandson of Pat Callahan and Attorney Jim Duffy, the son of Judge Dan Duffy." />
