  <title>The Wedding Sisters - Jamie Brenner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meryl Becker is living a mother&#39;s dream. The oldest of her three  beautiful daughters, Meg, is engaged to a wonderful man from one of the  country&#39;s most prominent families. Of course, Meryl wants to give Meg  the perfect wedding. Who wouldn&#39;t? But when her two younger daughters,  Amy and Jo, also become engaged to celebrated bachelors, Meryl has to  admit that three weddings is more than she and her husband, Hugh, can  realistically afford. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution? A triple wedding! At first,  it&#39;s a tough sell to the girls, and juggling three sets of future  in-laws is a logistical nightmare. But when Hugh loses his teaching job,  and Meryl&#39;s aging mother suddenly moves in with them, a triple wedding  is the only way to get all three sisters down the aisle. When the grand  plan becomes public, the onslaught of media attention adds to Meryl&#39;s  mounting pressure.  Suddenly, appearances are everything - and she will  do whatever it takes to keep the wedding on track as money gets tight,  her mother starts acting nutty, and her own thirty year marriage starts  to unravel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the weeks leading up to the nuptials, secrets  are revealed, passions ignite, and surprising revelations show Meryl and  her daughters the true meaning of love, marriage and family. Jamie Brenner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Sisters&lt;/i&gt; invites readers to the most unpredictable wedding of the year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
