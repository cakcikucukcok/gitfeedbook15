  <title>Sweet Black Release - Sara Coxin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam and his boyfriend Don live a pretty separate life, with Don leaving early and coming home late.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;#39;s a busy doctor at an understaffed hospital during flu season.&amp;nbsp; Sam used to work at the same hospital but quit to work a much easier schedule as a nurse at a smaller hospital.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After another rough day, Sam tries to cheer Don up and prepares a special something for him.&amp;nbsp; He slips into a tight little thong that wraps tightly around his manhood but finds Don knocked out.&amp;nbsp; Disappointed and feeling more frustrated, Sam goes to bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following day, Sam&amp;#39;s neighbor has a truck parked in front of her house.&amp;nbsp; Curiousity gets the better of him and he goes to check it out.&amp;nbsp; His neighbor, Jacqueline lets him know that her nephew is temporarily moving in and Sam&amp;#39;s jaw drops as he sees a huge black man step out from the truck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacqueline volunteers Sam to help her nephew while she steps out to visit her friends.&amp;nbsp; Sam agrees and watches as her nephew, Jamal carries around furniture as if they weigh nothing.&amp;nbsp; Once they nearly finish, he invites Sam in and things start to get interesting as Jamal introduces the frustrated Sam on the concept of releasing himself..." />
