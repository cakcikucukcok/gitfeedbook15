  <title>Any Duchess Will Do - Tessa Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s a duke to do, when the girl who&amp;#39;s perfectly wrong becomes the woman he can&amp;#39;t live without?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin York, the Duke of Halford, has no desire to wed this season&amp;#8212;or any season&amp;#8212;but his diabolical mother abducts him to &amp;#34;Spinster Cove&amp;#34; and insists he select a bride from the ladies in residence. Griff decides to teach her a lesson that will end the marriage debate forever. He chooses the serving girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overworked and struggling, Pauline Simms doesn&amp;#39;t dream about dukes. All she wants is to hang up her barmaid apron and open a bookshop. That dream becomes a possibility when an arrogant, sinfully attractive duke offers her a small fortune for a week&amp;#39;s employment. Her duties are simple: submit to his mother&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;duchess training&amp;#34;&amp;#8230; and fail miserably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in London, Pauline isn&amp;#39;t a miserable failure. She&amp;#39;s a brave, quick-witted, beguiling failure&amp;#8212;a woman who ignites Griff&amp;#39;s desire and soothes the darkness in his soul. Keeping Pauline by his side won&amp;#39;t be easy. Even if Society could accept a serving girl duchess&amp;#8212;can a roguish duke convince a serving girl to trust him with her heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
