      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a big world out there&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But was ex-nun Claire Santaniello ready for it? Her yearning for a home and family had her shedding her habit and moving back to California. But her true calling definitely wasn&#39;t with sexy single dad Caleb McClain. Was it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stunning redhead seemed uncomfortable in the crowded bar. She was also tantalizingly familiar. Caleb couldn&#39;t believe the girl he&#39;d once loved was now a teacher in their hometown. Soon after he rescued her from the dance floor, Claire made it her mission to bring out his softer side, arousing feelings Caleb couldn&#39;t ignore. Was it finally time for them to create the future together they both craved?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
