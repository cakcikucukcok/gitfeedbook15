  <title>&#39;Twas the Week Before Christmas (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Olivia Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;He loathed Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And yet here he was feeling downright merry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Something was very wrong here. He was out of his element and he wasn’t thinking clearly, it was as simple as that. He hadn’t had a vacation in too long. He was getting swept away. Yes, that was it. It had to be. But he had a job to do, a purpose for being here, and he needed to focus. He wasn’t here to flirt with the locals or get caught up in… festive activities. The sooner he got out of this town and back to his regular life in New York, the better he’d feel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But even as he processed this reassuring thought, his stomach rolled with uneasiness. He was struggling to convince himself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And that was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
