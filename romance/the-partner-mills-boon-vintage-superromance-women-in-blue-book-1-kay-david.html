  <title>The Partner (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (Women in Blue, Book 1) - Kay David</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;One bullet changed her life&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a heart-stopping moment she&#39;d never stop reliving, Risa Taylor lost everything–her partner, her friends, her career and her self-confidence. The family she was never close to has taken a step back and there&#39;s nowhere else to turn. Things can&#39;t get much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except, of course, they can. Every officer-involved shooting is investigated by Internal Affairs, and the man in charge is Grady Wilson, who&#39;s known for his unorthodox methods and his unquestionable results. At first glance, the case seems like a slam dunk, especially when the ballistics report shows that the bullet that killed her partner came from Risa&#39;s gun. But a phone call from an anonymous informant, and the feelings he starts to have for Risa, have Grady looking a little deeper, determined to find out what really happened on that steamy night in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
