  <title>No Turning Back - Ricky Ram贸n</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some stories are better left untold, because sometimes, the results of telling those stories can be fatal.
Kaiden&#39;s rise to success seems to be almost instant as his relationship with his artists and girlfriend also seem to improve. As Kaiden works to finish an upcoming album, he learns some news that changes his life. Quickly having to adapt to his new lifestyle is no easy task, but Kaiden keeps his mind set on being able to provide the best life for his family and all is well, until he and Christina&#39;s past quickly seem to catch up with them. It&#39;s a tale of twists and turns as two individuals who try to excel and progress are unable to do so because of things that they&#39;ve done in the past. They both learn that at some point, you can no longer be trapped in the past, but you have to be able to say that there&#39;s no turning back." />
