  <title>A Match Made in Bed - Cathy Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time there were three young ladies who, despite their fortunes, had been on the marriage mart a bit too long.&amp;#160;They were known as &amp;#8220;the Spinster Heiresses&amp;#8221; . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miss Cassandra Holwell is too tall, too bookish, and too smart&amp;#8212;but she does have money and a father who wants a grand title for her. Cassandra hasn&amp;#8217;t felt a desire to marry until she meets the sinfully handsome Duke of Camberly, who captures her imagination . . . until Soren York, Earl of Dewsberry and her family&amp;#8217;s sworn enemy, steps in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Holwells ruined Soren&amp;#8217;s family, and he&amp;#8217;s lived on the knife&amp;#8217;s edge trying to resurrect their fortunes . . . until he considers marrying the Holwell Heiress. Not only would her dowry give him the funds he needs, he has secretly had an eye on the independent-minded bluestocking since they both first realized the differences between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She likes to read; he has no patience for books. She knows little of sex; he is a man of the world and willing to school her. Her family destroyed his; his offer of marriage may be her only salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Cassandra and Soren must learn to love each other for &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; they are, not what they are&amp;#8212;and the lessons are becoming an exercise in absolute pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
