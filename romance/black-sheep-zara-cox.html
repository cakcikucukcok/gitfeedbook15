  <title>Black Sheep - Zara Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a family of cold-hearted black sheep, I, Axel Rutherford, am the blackest.&lt;br&gt;  My father has hated me since the day I was born. The feeling was mutual. In the shady underworld that was my legacy, Cleo McCarthy became my light. She was beautiful, passionate, and my whole world. So naturally my father had to destroy us. First he sent me away. Next he claimed Cleo as his own. But now I&#39;ve returned, and nothing will stop me from taking back everything that is rightfully mine. &lt;br&gt;  He was the love of my life - when my life was still my own. &lt;br&gt;  We were young enough to believe we would last forever, Axel and I. But neither of us realized how cruel life - and our families - could be. Now I&#39;m trapped in a gilded cage: desired by Axel, who must never know the full truth, and controlled by his father, who would sooner see me dead than free. And I wouldn&#39;t even care, except that it&#39;s no longer only my life at stake." />
