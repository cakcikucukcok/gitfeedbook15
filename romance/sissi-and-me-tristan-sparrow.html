  <title>Sissi and Me - Tristan Sparrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Brother Sister Incest - an Erotic Romance story of sibling ribaldry based upon real people and real events. The story of a brother and sister whose quest for fulfillment leads them down a shadowy path - to what? An erotically shocking romance, but one with a message for all who profess an interest in the institutions of marriage and the family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
She ran to me, but Georg leapt with long legs, drunken yet still sure of his mark. He caught my sister, grabbing her by the waist and holding her against her will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Vat do you vant viss him, Sissi? He is choost an artist. An Untermensch. Shtay mit me, and ve vill leaf for Germany to-night! Ve can haf breakfast in Bavaria. A-hahahahaha!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was not unconscious, though perhaps I should have been. What I was, was lucky. The back of my head throbbed, and I felt like a broken marionette. Could I move?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My sister continued to struggle against our unwelcome guest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Take your filthy hands off of me, Georg! I don&amp;rsquo;t want you! I never have!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t lie to me, you vicked bitch!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And with that, he crossed the final line. In a quick, drunken movement, he reached down and tore Sissi&amp;rsquo;s beautiful gown, ripping the top open and off her. My sister stood there in shock, humiliated and naked from the waist up. She screamed and reflexively covered her breasts with her hands. In a split-second, I finally beheld her beautiful breasts, and they were every bit as gorgeous as I had always supposed. But Georg Silberbauer had seen them, too, and that was unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What occurred next seemingly happened in slow-motion, though it, too, was only another split-second. Renewed energy and life came rushing back into me, the adrenaline that so often blesses human beings in times of emergency and great stress. I stood, making a computer-like computation about Georg&amp;rsquo;s ribcage and his ursine jaw line. As an artist, I had acquired a profound knowledge of human anatomy. And I knew that a blow to a man&amp;rsquo;s jaw, placed correctly, could render him unconscious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You animal!&amp;rdquo; I roared and flew through the air. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My left hand struck him hard in the ribs, and I heard something snap. My right then came up and struck his jaw, and he fell back upon the floor. I found myself on top of him, straddling his barrel-like chest, and I landed another blow across his face for good measure, dislodging two of his yellowing teeth in the process. They clattered to the floor like marbles. But Georg was already out like a light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sissi was awash in profound relief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Joey! Oh, thank God! Thank you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She knelt and flung her arms round me, crying and covering my cheeks with kisses. The swell of her breasts crushed against my chest. For an instant, I returned her embrace, running my hands across her back and through her hair, now undone and cascading round her shoulders and down to her feet. But then I remembered myself and immediately shucked off my jacket, trying, out of a sense of honour, not to look at my gorgeous sister&amp;rsquo;s bounteous, beauteous bosom, even though it was obscured by an angelic avalanche of brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;
