  <title>The Long Home - William Gay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In a literary voice that is both original and powerfully unsettling, William Gay tells the story of Nathan Winer, a young and headstrong Tennessee carpenter who lost his father years ago to a human evil that is greater and closer at hand than any the boy can imagine - until he learns of it first-hand. Gay&#39;s remarkable debut novel, &lt;I&gt;The Long Home&lt;/I&gt;, is also the story of Amber Rose, a beautiful young woman forced to live beneath that evil who recognizes even as a child that Nathan is her first and last chance at escape. And it is the story of William Tell Oliver, a solitary old man who watches the growing evil from the dark woods and adds to his own weathered guilt by failing to do anything about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Set in rural Tennessee in the 1940s, &lt;I&gt;The Long Home&lt;/I&gt; will bring to mind once again the greatest Southern novelists and will haunt the reader with its sense of solitude , longing, and the deliverance that is always just out of reach.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
