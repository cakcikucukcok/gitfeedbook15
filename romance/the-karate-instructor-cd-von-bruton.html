  <title>The Karate Instructor - Cd Von Bruton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cute, petite and sassy Allison Parker, Karate Instructor, is asked by the devastatingly handsome pediatrician, Roark Sullivan, to help him with his fifteen year old niece who was paralyzed in a car accident.  Roark believes learning the Korean martial art of Tang Soo Do, will give Shelly a new interest in life, and help her to overcome the mental anguish and physical devastation wrought by the accident.
     Roark soon finds himself helplessly in love with Allison and after just a few short weeks proposes the most romantic thing hes ever done in his life.  On impulse he pulls in front of the courthouse in his hometown and asks Alli to marry him.  He can hardly believe it when she agrees to his proposal, and they are married within the hour.
     Instead of finding marriage to her satisfying, Roark finds himself cut completely out of Allisons life because of what she believes is a repeated past mistake. An unlikely source of help steps in, in the form of Allisons sixteen-year-old sons father.  Daniel Snyder, a man who still loves her after seventeen years, walks in and gives Roark some much needed advice and the courage to face her.
     You will be taken inside the exciting world of martial arts competition and given insight into the compassion of a modern day pediatrician.
     This manuscript confronts past mistakes, incites compassion for a lost love, and over comes the problems faced by a new love." />
