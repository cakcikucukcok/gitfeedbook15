  <title>Podrovsky&#39;s Line - B.A. Rewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you ever thought your family was complicated, meet Vladimir Podrovsky.
Have you ever had your parents tell you Its time for bed or rest? Well
Vladimir must continually tell his people that its time to rest.
Have you ever been talking to your children and feel like youre a broken record?
This is Vladimirs problem. Hes constantly repeating himself with every one of the vampires within his line.
He fully accepts that these men and women are his responsibility; the problem is that they just dont seem to want to listen.
On top of all his familial issues there is a vindictive vampire trying to eliminate him and some of the men in his family." />
