  <title>Falling For His Best Friend: Falling for His Best Friend / Reunited with Her Parisian Surgeon (Mills &amp; Boon Medical) - Emily Forbes, Annie O&#39;Neil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falling for His Best Friend&lt;/em&gt; by Emily Forbes&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;They’ve been friends for ever…&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;But now he wants so much more!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When nurse Kitty Nelson becomes a surrogate for her sister, her best friend paramedic Joe Harkness is right there for her. But as Kitty’s pregnancy blossoms Joe begins to see her in a very different light! Finally he admits a connection he’s never felt with anyone else—is it too late to convince Kitty they’re meant to be?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reunited with her Parisian Surgeon &lt;/em&gt;by Annie O’Neil&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Raphael’s heart was lost… &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Until he found Maggie again! &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brooding surgeon Dr Raphael Boucher finds his way to Sydney and the one woman he has never been able to forget. As they work together, it’s clear that Maggie Louis is the only one who can make him feel alive again. But Raphael must return to Paris and resolve his past before they can finally be together…&lt;/p&gt;
