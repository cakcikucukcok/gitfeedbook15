  <title>A Peculiar Courtship - Laura Beers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lord Jonathon Beckett&amp;rsquo;s mission is simple: retrieve Lady Hannah and place her under the protection of the Crown. But he isn&amp;rsquo;t prepared for the havoc she inflicts on his world, making him question whether his duty as an agent of the Crown should always come before his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Hannah&amp;#39;s father has uncovered evidence exposing a French traitor to the Crown. Willing to do anything to silence him, the traitor&amp;#39;s primary target has become Lady Hannah. Keeping her safe means locking her away from Society, but she refuses to stand idly by, letting others put their lives on the line to protect her. Instead, she will stop at nothing to learn to defend herself, even at the risk of losing Lord Jonathon&amp;rsquo;s protection, or his affections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a sinister scheme in play to collapse the English government from within, Lord Jonathon must protect Lady Hannah from the French spies intending to use her as a pawn in their game of treachery. But can he protect her from herself?&lt;/p&gt;" />
