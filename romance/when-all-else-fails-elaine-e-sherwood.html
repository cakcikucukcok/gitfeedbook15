  <title>When All Else Fails - Elaine E. Sherwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its one of lifes most bitter and unavoidable lessons: bad things happen to good people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its those choices we make after such catastrophes that really matter. When all else fails, survivors learn to keep their hearts open because in the end, they trust that love always wins. For Kathy Martin and Bryce Peterson, whose young lives were darkened with cruelty, tragedy, and abuse, its a lesson they learned early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathys once-ideal childhood was suddenly shattered by tragedy, and she was cast into the callous waters of the foster care system. Terrified and alone, she embarks on a grueling journey to adulthood. Scarred both physically and emotionally, her heart remains closely guarded as a survival strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Bryce, a forgotten child from an abusive family, his own path has been littered with sadness and crushing disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, against all odds, these two damaged souls have found each other. Perhaps, for the first time, they both dare to hope that from the twisted wreckage of their lives, a miracle might emerge. Can they discover true love- something they never believed was possible?&lt;/p&gt;" />
