&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Christian wizard. It seemed like a bad joke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, maybe, after, all, he wasn&amp;#39;t quite as unique as he feared. He thought about Newton, the brilliant mind behind The Principia, which had lain the foundations for physics for three centuries, but who had also taught himself Hebrew, so he could better understand the floor plans of the Great Temple in Jerusalem, where he hoped to find hints about the date of the Second Coming of Christ. Or Darwin, whose faith had been so sorely tested while he wrote On the Origin of Species that he had essentially tossed the manuscript into a drawer for over a decade, until Alfred Russel Wallace&amp;#39;s work in the Malay Archipelago had pushed him to publish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hour of sunset passed. Having reached an internal truce with himself, he walked out the back door, still dressed in the robe he had brought to the house, half as a joke. Following Evanora&amp;#39;s instructions, he let his robe slip off his shoulders as he walked naked down the narrow flight of steps that led into the pool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He ducked down, submerging his nude body in the water. High in the sky, the waxing moon shone down on him, bathing the yard in a thin, silvery light. Emerging, he threw his head back, dashing water from his eyes, blinking as thin streams ran down his face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then Evanora came out, and he lost all ability for thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was naked, and she strode towards him like a queen, like a goddess, like the perfect female form made flesh. Her legs were long and lean, her stomach flat, the fiery patch of hair at her pubis neatly trimmed. Her breasts, which he had seen in tantalizing glimpses throughout the day, were large, high, and firm, and pointed ever-so-slightly upward. Her eyes, shadowed in the dim light, were wise, and her face was serene&amp;nbsp; a woman who had seen her Goddess and knew that She approved of her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly, gracefully, she stepped down into the pool. When her eyes caught and held his, it was all he could do to hold back an involuntary flinch. There was power there. Power enough to send him reeling, untrained as he was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thomas Oberon Winkler. Is it your wish to undergo training as a wizard, to be my apprentice, and to give yourself to the service of the Light?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He swallowed. &amp;quot;It is, Mistress.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;By what do you swear?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;By my power. And by my name.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded. He lowered his eyes as she cupped her hands, raised them, and poured the gathered water over his head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be thou shriven.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be thou bound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be thou sanctified.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be thou baptized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be thou courageous, and honorable, and strong.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the fifth double handful of water trickled away, Thomas blinked, clearing his eyes. All through the ceremony, he had felt the air around them tensing, growing charged as with electricity before a thunderstorm. But the air was still warm and dry, the skies above still clear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He looked at Evanora, and knew that she felt it, too. Her eyes were wide and wild as she gazed at him, her pupils dilated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be thou my lover,&amp;quot; she whispered, and Thomas saw, to his startlement, that he was erect, only a hairs-width from the pale belly of his mistress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who put her hands on his shoulders, drew his head down, and kissed him with a skill and passion he could scarcely believe." />
