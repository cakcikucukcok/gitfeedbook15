          &lt;strong&gt;Marriage at a Distance&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joanna had been an inexperienced 18-year-old when she&#39;d married Gabriel Verne. She&#39;d loved her new husband but had been devastated to discover that he&#39;d simply married her out of duty. When the honeymoon was over, so was their marriage….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But then Gabriel returned home to claim his inheritance– and his wife! By the terms of his late father&#39;s will, he and Joanna must live together as man and wife for a year. Joanna was determined to resist, but Gabriel wanted her back– whatever it took!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Marriage Under Suspicion&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Your husband loves another woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The note was signed &quot;A Friend,&quot; but no friend would ever do that to another woman. Could it be true? Was Kate Lassiter&#39;s marriage falling apart? She still loved her husband, Ryan, still thrilled at his touch, but how long was it since they&#39;d last made love?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the surface they had it all: successful careers, a lovely home and the perfect marriage. But if Ryan had committed the ultimate betrayal, then revenge was no answer. Kate wanted her husband back and she was prepared to fight to keep him. Because while her marriage was under suspicion there was no way she could tell Ryan she was expecting his baby!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Marriage Truce&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jenna is happy to be her cousin&#39;s bridesmaid, but she wishes someone had warned her that the best man is going to be Ross Grantham. Ross is the man she once exchanged marriage vows with – in the very same church! It&#39;s two years since she last saw him; two years since Ross betrayed their vows. The air between them crackled with fiery attraction. Can they call a truce for the bride&#39;s sake?&lt;/p&gt;
