She&#39;s looking for trouble...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a successful doctor and weekend cowboy, Chase Cooper enjoys a full life with plenty of female company. But lately, something hasn&#39;t felt right. He&#39;s been distracted. Antsy. Damn it, he&#39;s been &lt;i&gt;lonely&lt;/i&gt;. With an eye on settling down with a nice girl, Coop invites his high school best friend down to his ranch to see if maybe she&#39;s the one for him...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her twin sister shows up. The one who &lt;i&gt;loathes&lt;/i&gt; him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia Blair is already halfway to Coop&#39;s ranch when she learns the invitation wasn&#39;t for her, but her vivacious twin sister. She has two choices: slink back home, or see just how far this farce will go. One glance at hotter-than-sin Coop, and she knows she&#39;s playing a dangerously hot game. Because what this cowboy wants, this cowboy gets...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previously released on Entangled&#39;s Flaunt imprint as &lt;i&gt;Cowboy&#39;s Way&lt;/i&gt; - November 2013 and has been enhanced with new material.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
