  <title>The Governess Club: Louisa - Ellie Macdonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For fans of Christina Dodd and Elizabeth Boyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisa Brockhurst is on the run&amp;#8212;from her friends, from her family, even from her dream of independence through the Governess Club. But sometimes it&amp;#39;s easier for her to hide from those she loves in order to escape the secrets of her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handsome but menacing John Taylor is a prizefighter-turned-innkeeper who is trying to make his way in society. When Louisa shows up at his doorstep, he&amp;#39;s quick to accept her offer to help&amp;#8212;at a price. He knows that she&amp;#39;s hiding something, and he can&amp;#39;t help his protective instincts toward the beautiful woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their attraction grows, but will headstrong, fiery Louisa ever trust the surprisingly kind John enough to tell him the dangerous secrets from her past that keep her running? Or will the power of her feelings scare her into running yet again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
