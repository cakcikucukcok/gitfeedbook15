      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The romantic...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her boss offers her free tickets to the CMA Fest, Ava Trent jumps at the chance for a weekend in Nashville with her best girlfriends. Great music and new opportunities to look for Mr Right? What more could a former country girl ask for? Well, maybe not to literally fall at the feet of the hottest guy she&#39;s ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;And the superstar singer...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming an overnight success, fame doesn&#39;t rest easy on Chase Hudson&#39;s shoulders. It&#39;s hard to tell who&#39;s interested in him and who&#39;s interested in the star. So when he and Ava collide, and she has no idea who he is, he&#39;s immediately intrigued. Something about Ava calls to him - even though he&#39;s convinced she&#39;s a city-type who couldn&#39;t handle his Nashville life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are about to get their country on.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What starts as a light-hearted bet to test one another, becomes something much deeper as Ava and Chase can&#39;t stay away from one another. But with so many differences between their lives, will they win the relationship they&#39;ve been dreaming of? Or lose each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Girls Weekend Away series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* What Happens in Vegas&lt;br&gt;* Meet Me In San Francisco&lt;br&gt;* The Nashville Bet&lt;br&gt;* A Match Made in Monaco&lt;/p&gt;" />
