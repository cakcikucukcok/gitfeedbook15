  <title>Heir Of The Mist - Raquel Pagno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inácio Vaz could hardly believe in his dream coming true. He had just arrived in Paris, with some coins in his pocket and a strong wish to be a lawyer. He had rented a small room in a cheap inn, and had gotten a miserable job that would provide him a roof and a maintenance for years ahead. While he was waiting for the interview that guaranteed him a scholarship at the Sorbonne, he was amazed by the beauty of Chloé Champoudry. The fire-haired girl had charmed him so much that when he was called to chose his course, he had mistakenly chosen Artsi nstead of Laws just to be in her company. Desperate about abdicating his dream, Inácio discovers that his name is not on any lists of the university. In order to solve the misunderstanding, Inácio does not realize that his documents have been changed. The face in the photo is yours, but the name, on it is other. Stephen, his roommate, tries to convince him to take on the new identity. The documents belong to the heir of the Roux dynasty, a disappeared millionaire with no trace. Tangled in a range of lies and suspense, Inácio fights against his own conscience, while in love, searches for the girl who had stolen his heart.&lt;br/&gt;" />
