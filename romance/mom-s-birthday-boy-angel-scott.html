  <title>Mom’s Birthday Boy - Angel Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Birthday&amp;#39;s can be lonely, sad, or fun! For poor Casey, it seemed to be all three! He needed love and attention because his girlfriend was a selfish bitch! He turned to his mom, and got the best birthday gifts ever!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
The desk stood in the middle of the room. As Casey walked closer, he could see the name on it; Casey Colver. Water started to form inside Casey&amp;rsquo;s eyes. Something Casey always wanted standing right in front of him! A small law firm!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom!&amp;rdquo; Casey exclaimed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Happy Birthday!&amp;rdquo; She shrieked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How?&amp;rdquo; Casey held his hands up into the air and pointed around the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Your dad&amp;rsquo;s and my money. Plus, your grandpa helped too.&amp;rdquo; Carrie explained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Casey ran up to his mom and hugged her tightly. &amp;ldquo;Thank you, mom. I love you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I love you too, baby.&amp;rdquo; Carrie beamed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Casey let go of his mom and wondered something, &amp;ldquo;How will I ever pay you and granddad back, mom?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Your grandpa doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be paid back and neither do I,&amp;rdquo; Carrie explained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But I will feel bad, at least let me do something for you mom.&amp;rdquo; Casey sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, &amp;hellip; we can fool around again if you would like.&amp;rdquo; Carrie said boldly. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where that idea or boldness came from, but she sure wanted to do more fun stuff with her son now that they crossed that filthy line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Really? You&amp;rsquo;re willing to?&amp;rdquo; Casey asked with a loud squeak in his voice. Just like a teenager going through puberty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carrie nodded, &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, well, wanna do it in here?&amp;rdquo; Casey asked as he pointed to the desk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carrie nodded. She started to take her pink tank top off slowly. The thin material moved upward and exposed her white, soft, skin. Within seconds, Carrie took her bra off her breasts to expose those precious, round, perky tits. Her nipples already looked erect from the cool air, and the excitement. She stood there proudly knowing that her tits looked good. With only one child, your tits could still look perky. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky. Carrie managed to get lucky with her tits. Perky tits ran in the family. Thank god! Carrie thought to herself as she took her short skirt off slowly. The thin material moved down slowly causing goosebumps to form on Carrie&amp;rsquo;s arms and legs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Casey could feel his cock re-act as his mom took his panties off and stripped in front of him! He wanted to fuck the shit out of his mom right now! Without even touching, Casey could get hard just seeing his mom naked and apparently getting naked. No other woman could make Casey feel that way before. He hurried to take his own clothes off, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t just slowly take them off because he just wanted them off. He yanked them off and hurried to his mom&amp;rsquo;s naked body before she changed her mind on him. He grabbed onto his mom and kissed her with passion. While kissing, Casey moved him and his mom over to the desk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within seconds, Carrie could feel the desk on her ass. The desk didn&amp;rsquo;t feel very comfortable, or warm, but she ignored the uneasy object and concentrated on her son. She kissed him back with passion and then grabbed on to his cock with her hand. She moved the cock to her damp pussy and moved her ass back and forth against her son&amp;rsquo;s crotch. The cock moved back and forth against her pussy. The cock moved against her slit and then moved up to her clit.&lt;br /&gt;
