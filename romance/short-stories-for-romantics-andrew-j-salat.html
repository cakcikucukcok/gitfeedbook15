  <title>Short Stories for Romantics - Andrew J. Salat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The famous songwriter Cole Porter once asked, What Is This Thing Called Love? His question caused author Andrew J. Salat to wonder: is the condition physical, spiritual, or, as some cynics might describe, a temporary madness of the heart? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salat believes Mr. Porters question is answered quite well in Short Stories for Romantics. The story High Heels is a haunting tale of love found and lost, told to him by an interesting airline passenger. Adriennes Room takes the reader on an unforgettable roller-coaster ride. For a more spiritual journey, High Level Meeting seeks to bring on second thoughts about the way we live our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sixteen stories take the reader on an imaginary sojourn we all must take in order to experience true love in our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Salat is a gifted storyteller with imagination and eloquent style. His stories had me turning pages to the very last.  Beverly DeGeorge, literary consultant&lt;/p&gt;" />
