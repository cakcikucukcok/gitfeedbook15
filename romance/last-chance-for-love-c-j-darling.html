      <meta name="description" content="Kayla Farrell lost three years of her life after a tragic car crash, but her dead husband is determined to give her a second chance at life&amp;mdash;and love. Hollywood superstar Alex Matthews may hold her heart, but a bitter divorce has left him emotionally scarred. Can Alex and Kayla find the strength to overcome their paralyzing fears and embrace true love before their time together runs out?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kayla would always remember that first golden glimpse of Alex Matthews, looking like a guilty little kid caught in the cookie jar, while his normally-sober partner roared with laughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A keen pang of disappointment lanced through her heart. Of course she hadn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;expected them to act just like their TV roles&amp;mdash;yet somehow she had, anyway! Foolish of her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She knew their screen characters intimately. She knew what they&amp;rsquo;d say, how they&amp;rsquo;d say it, how they&amp;rsquo;d react to any given situation. But these two glorious, larger-than-life people were total strangers to her. Suddenly she felt very shy, and more than a little awkward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alicia stepped forward first, and warmly clasped her hand. &amp;ldquo;Welcome to paradise!&amp;rdquo; she smiled, instinctively liking what she saw in the younger woman&amp;rsquo;s crystal-blue eyes. &amp;ldquo;Or as we like to call it, The Madhouse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her grip was strong, yet somehow compassionate. Kayla felt her tensed nerves relax slightly. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Huntington,&amp;rdquo; she smiled, and meant every word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quinn MacAllister had brought her back to life. Alicia&amp;rsquo;s character, Mariah Conners, had given her courage and strength through those first long months, when she&amp;rsquo;d been struggling to accept her grim new circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alicia heard the sincerity in her voice, and remembered the rumors. Sometime soon, they&amp;rsquo;d have to cozy up for a nice long chat. But in the meantime&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Allie, please,&amp;rdquo; she urged, waving aside propriety with an easy smile. &amp;ldquo;A film set&amp;rsquo;s no place for formality!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re the one she&amp;rsquo;s here to see.&lt;/i&gt; Allie&amp;rsquo;s cheerful voice echoed in Alex&amp;rsquo;s ears as he drew a deep, steadying breath, and tried to still his racing pulse. &lt;i&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s make her week a memorable one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was an actor. He could handle this. No one else needed to know how his heart was pounding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He stepped forward with a beaming smile pasted on his face. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to finally meet you, Kayla Farrell. Welcome to Paradise Island!&amp;rdquo; And he forced himself to clasp her outstretched hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Heat exploded in his palm, and seared all the way up his arm and shoulder. Startled, he took a hasty step back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whatever he&amp;rsquo;d expected, her skin was vibrant and warm from the overhead noon sun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He became aware of a fierce thudding in his belly&amp;mdash;one that had nothing to do with her dreaded wheelchair, and everything to do with the heavy anvil gut-punching him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alicia&amp;rsquo;s eyebrows rose slightly as hot color flooded Kayla&amp;rsquo;s cheeks. So the sparks were already flying, how interesting! Sudden intriguing possibilities began to dance through her clever mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now you&amp;rsquo;ll have to watch out for this one,&amp;rdquo; she teased, slyly canting her head in Alex&amp;rsquo;s direction. &amp;ldquo;Thinks he&amp;rsquo;s too good for the likes of us, and he&amp;rsquo;ll lead your poor heart on a merry chase if you give him a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kayla glanced up at her in surprise. An oblique warning? To guard herself, or to not poach on another woman&amp;rsquo;s territory?" />
