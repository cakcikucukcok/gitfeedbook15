  <title>Until We Break - Jamie Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Sloane Avery stops to help a stranded driver, she finds more than a broken down car on the side of the road. Luke Evans is faster and sexier than her Maserati, but with her heart still on the mend, she&#39;s not interested in taking him for a test drive. Despite their initial disdain for each other, emotion and passion simmer, complicating their fragile friendship. But when a tragic loss and devastating betrayal send them spiraling, their growing love isn&#39;t enough to save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was five years ago, practically a different lifetime and definitely a different Sloane. Before she&#39;s been hardened by booze, sex, and as much distance as she could get from the past. Now, called home on a family emergency, she&#39;s determined to hold onto her heart the next time she sees Luke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except Sloane&#39;s not the only one who&#39;s changed. Luke&#39;s turned his life around. Only the reappearance of Sloane and the reminder of his biggest mistake can put a dent in his plans. Luke is set on fixing what he&#39;s broken. But with her emotions boiling to the surface, Sloane needs to decide if falling in love is life&#39;s greatest gift or its cruelest joke.&lt;/p&gt;" />
