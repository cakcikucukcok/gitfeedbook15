  <title>Regency Temptation: The Greatest of Sins / The Fall of a Saint (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Christine Merrill</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Greatest of Sins&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having spent years believing a lie about his birth, Dr Samuel Hastings has been condemned to a personal hell of his desire’s making – his sinful thoughts of the one woman he can never touch would damn his soul for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lady Evelyn Thorne is engaged to the very suitable Duke of St Aldric when a shocking truth is revealed – and now Sam will play every bit of the devil to seduce the woman he thought would always be denied him! The Sinner and the Saint Brothers separated at birth, brought together by scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Fall of a Saint&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Honourable—and handsome to boot!—Michael Poole, Duke of St Aldric, has earned his nickname ‘The Saint’. But the &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; would shudder if they knew the truth. Because, thrust into a world of debauchery, this saint has turned sinner!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the appearance of fallen governess Madeline Cranston—carrying his heir—St Aldric looks for redemption through a marriage of convenience. But the intriguing Madeline is far from a dutiful duchess, and soon this saint is indulging in the most &lt;em&gt;sinful&lt;/em&gt; of thoughts…while his new wife vows to make him pay for his past.&lt;/p&gt;
