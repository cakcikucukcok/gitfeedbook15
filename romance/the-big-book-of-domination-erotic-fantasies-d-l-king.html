  <title>The Big Book of Domination: Erotic Fantasies - D. L. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not every woman likes to submit. An increasing number like to be on top. And their partners love it! D. L. King, editor of 2013&#39;s award-winning Under Her Thumb, curates a scintillating collection with The Big Book of Domination. Filled with surprises and unexpected twists (yes, that kind, too!), this book proves that when lust and desire take control, all bets are off. Dominants and submissives are not so very different &amp;#8212; they both crave that frisson of power. The Big Book of Domination brings you erotic stories to get your heart pumping, like the story of a reporter who likes to experience everything first hand. It&amp;#8217;s been said that clothes make the man &amp;#8212; can putting on the right clothes transform an ordinary man into a charismatic dom? When Glenn finds the leathers in his friend&amp;#8217;s closet, his trip to the bars nets him the perfect boy . . . Dominance and submission is a dance D. L. King knows well, and The Big Book of Domination rocks your world with stories of sensuous games with male dominants, training and discipline by female dominants, and all manner of sensuous games and pairings." />
