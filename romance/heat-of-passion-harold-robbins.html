  <title>Heat of Passion - Harold Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Win Liberte has it all. He prides himself on never having worked a day in his life. He has everything he wants - fast cars, beautiful women, a racing yacht, a penthouse in Manhattan. Orphaned at eleven, Win inherited an international diamond business that is managed by his uncle.&lt;br&gt;Then Win loses it all when his uncle commits suicide after investing all of Win&#39;s money in a scheme that fails. His single remaining asset is a bankrupt diamond mine in Angola, a steaming, war-ravaged country in equatorial Africa. &lt;br&gt;In the blood and muck of central Africa, Win experiences the &quot;Diamond Curse&quot; first hand. Battles over Angola&#39;s vast wealth in gems occur daily, and fights for control of the diamond industry have wiped out generations. Thriving on the challenge, Win founds an international diamond business that challenges a powerful cartel&#39;s stranglehold on the market.&lt;br&gt;Loved by two women - a movie goddess who sears men&#39;s souls and a dedicated UN worker who risks her life in Africa - Win doesn&#39;t find anything worth living for until he loses love.&lt;br&gt;From the tunnels of the diamond mine to the stage at the Academy Awards, from the beds of beautiful women to a battle with warlords, Win has to fight to get back everything he ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
