  <title>Daddy&#39;s Princess - Rae Roman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Jake Masters is Becca&amp;#39;s long absent father in town for their first meeting. For eighteen long years Becca has wondered and asked about her father but her mother refuses to tell her anything about him. After her mother dies in a car crash two years earlier Becca lives with her mother&amp;#39;s sister, Vi, who tells her the tragic story when she is eighteen. An intense sexual attraction flares between Jake and Becca at first sight, one they cannot resist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I do my business and check my appearance in the multiple mirrors behind the sinks. My blue-gray eyes have a bright glitter to them that makes them look silver blue and my skin is flushed a deep rose color. When I slick more pink lip gloss across my full lips my hand trembles. Get a grip on yourself! This is not a date! This man is your biological father! Do not dare make a fool out of yourself. This is just a freak attraction, nothing more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking a deep breath, I open the bathroom door into the darkened hallway. As I move past a shadowy alcove a strong hand reaches out gripping my upper arm in a tight hold. I am jerked up against a tall hard muscular body and held in a grip so tight I am unable to break free of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Get your fucking hands off me, asshole!&amp;rdquo; I twist and squirm against the rock-hard arms holding me immobile. I can&amp;rsquo;t make out his face in the shadows, but my body recognizes his smell as his hard mouth comes crashing down on my softer one. I hold my lips pressed together in a hard line refusing his probing tongue entrance to my mouth. One hard hand holds both my wrists together behind my back while the other hand wraps around my throat in a firm choke hold. I cannot take a deep breath until he loosens his long fingers around my throat. I take a deep breath through my mouth and he takes instant advantage by plunging his tongue deep within my open orifice. His marauding tongue instantly wraps around my own sucking it with a powerful force into his wet hot mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am helpless against his power and strength as a bone melting lethargy sweeps over me. To my shame I kiss him back allowing him to keep my tongue prisoner in his hungry mouth. The hand around my throat slides down to capture my right breast and to fondle and stroke my turgid nipple through my thin tee shirt. My body arches against him in a wanton effort to push my breast deeper into his hand. He lifts me higher onto his leg to allow his knee to slide between my thighs. I grind my jeans clad wet pussy in hopeless abandon against it. I am lost in a blistering heat so intense my breath comes hot against his demanding mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pulling his mouth away from my swollen lips his smoky-gray eyes burn with a brightness that only the fires of lust and desire can ignite. I know mine must look the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Time to stop fooling ourselves, baby girl. We know exactly what this is between us, right? Tell daddy what you want.&amp;rdquo; His hot mouth latches onto my neck and he sucks with a strong delicious pressure while I dry hump his hard thigh. No thought is in my head except I need to get closer to him. So much closer. My cunt aches for his cock stretching it to fit his length and breadth. I moan my agreement, but he wants more. He wants to hear the words from my own mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I want you to fuck me, daddy. Right now.&amp;rdquo; I want him more than I have ever wanted anything in my life. No matter who he is. Or what I am to him. The need is all that matters." />
