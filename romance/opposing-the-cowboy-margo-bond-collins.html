      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never trust a good kisser...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yoga teacher LeeAnn Walker has no desire to see the unspoilt beauty of her grandmother&#39;s ranch violated by a greedy oil company. But unless she finds the paperwork confirming she owns the mineral rights, that&#39;s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what could happen. The worst part?

And she&#39;s not too happy to find out she might be forced to allow drilling on her land. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Jonah has a job to do, even if LeeAnn tempts him to turn his professionalism into something &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more personal...&lt;/p&gt;" />
