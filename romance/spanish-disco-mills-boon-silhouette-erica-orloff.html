  <title>Spanish Disco (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Erica Orloff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Real life was messy. Sloppy bathrooms I could handle. Love I could not.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For thirty-three-year-old Cassie Hayes, life is about to get messier. She can&#39;t cook, unless you count coffee as a meal (she does). She can&#39;t commit (just ask her ex-husband). She drinks too much (tequila for breakfast). Of course, she has guided her share of authors to the bestseller list for the literary publishing house where she works (when she makes it to the office). And now she must coax a sequel out of a Pulitzer Prize-winning author-turned-recluse. Moving in with the recluse is one thing, but teaching him the hustle so he can win the heart of his Spanish housekeeper is way beyond the call of duty.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cassie slowly unravels, with no coffeehouses, no bagels and nothing but sand for nightlife. On top of that, she&#39;s having phone sex with her favorite author, the mysterious, London-based Michael Pearton, who has suddenly decided to ruin their perfect affair by insisting that after five years they meet in person. Add a tabloid reporter who is after the literary story of a lifetime, and Cassie&#39;s dance card is full.&lt;/p&gt;
