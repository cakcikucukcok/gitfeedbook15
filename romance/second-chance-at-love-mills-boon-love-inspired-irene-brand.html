  <title>Second Chance at Love (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) - Irene Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;College sweethearts Amelia Stone and Chase Ramsey had married right after graduation, but infidelity destroyed their young marriage. Now, more than a decade later, severe flooding in West Virginia had brought them together again in their mellow years. They were older, wiser…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and both had become Christians. Their working side by side for disaster relief rekindled the flame that had never been extinguished, and they learned what makes a marriage truly last–patience and forgiveness. Was God giving this special couple a second chance at love?&lt;/p&gt;
