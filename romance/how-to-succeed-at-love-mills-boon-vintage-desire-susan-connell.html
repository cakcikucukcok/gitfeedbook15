          &lt;strong&gt;DATELESS AND DISTRESSED &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jade Macleod had been dumped by her boyfriend, fired from her important job… and her high-school reunion was days away! The girl voted &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot; was preparing to show up as a total loser… until sexy stranger Spencer Madison agreed to help her out - just for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;SEXY BUT SUSPICIOUS &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Spencer was really a reporter after a story, and he&#39;d decided the information only Jade could give him was just a dance in the high-school gym away. But her unexpected success at making him throb all over was distracting. And soon Spencer also wanted to be the most likely to succeed - at luring Jade into his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; THE GIRLS MOST LIKELY TO… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Three high-school friends are now all grown up… and they&#39;ve exceeded everyone&#39;s expectations in life - and in love!&lt;/p&gt;
