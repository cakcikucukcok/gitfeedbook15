Leah&#39;s unsure of why Frank&#39;s bringing it up, but he let&#39;s her know that he trusts Tony and he wants Tony and Leah to fulfill that fantasy. She&#39;s surprised, but doesn&#39;t see what the big deal is and decides to fulfill his fantasy. But as she pulls down Tony&#39;s pants, she begins to wonder if she&#39;s taken on a challenge she can&#39;t meet..." />
