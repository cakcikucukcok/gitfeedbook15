  <title>The Wedding Dress Diaries (Mills &amp; Boon Short Stories) (The Wedding Season) - Aimee Carson</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Get in the bridal spirit with this prequel novella to the fabulous new Mills &amp; Boon Modern Tempted contemporary romance series, The Wedding Season!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bridal shop owner Amber Davis dreaded the moment she&#39;d run in to Parker Robinson while working on his sister&#39;s wedding. She&#39;d spent every summer in the Hamptons with his family as a kid, fantasizing about kissing him. But she&#39;s shocked to discover that the confident boy who&#39;d given Amber her first taste of love has become a man who mocks its very existence.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Parker can&#39;t believe the girl who used to follow him around has grown into a beautiful woman—one with some very naughty ideas when she fits him for his tux. But Amber also knows why he&#39;s shut everyone out of his life. She&#39;s not the kind of woman Parker gets involved with…even if he can&#39;t keep his hands off her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amber doesn&#39;t do one-night stands or casual hookups, but she&#39;s wanted Parker long enough to make him an exception—especially if she can convince him he needs love in his life, too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Look for all four books in the Wedding Season series from Mills &amp; Boon Modern Tempted: &lt;em&gt;The Unexpected Wedding Guest&lt;/em&gt; by Aimee Carson, &lt;em&gt;Girl Least Likely to Marry&lt;/em&gt; by Amy Andrews,&lt;em&gt;Maid of Dishonor&lt;/em&gt; by Heidi Rice and &lt;em&gt;Last Groom Standing&lt;/em&gt; by Kimberly Lang.&lt;/strong&gt;
