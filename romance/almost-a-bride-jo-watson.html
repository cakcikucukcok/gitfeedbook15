  <title>Almost a Bride - Jo Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;That awkward moment you catch your boyfriend in bed with another woman and then mistakenly get arrested #chargesdropped&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Annie knows life isn&#39;t always fair. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose. Sometimes you get mistaken for a crazed intruder when you come home early and find your boyfriend wearing nipple clamps with a coworker on the night you thought he was going to propose to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The important thing is to move on, and for Annie that means treating herself to a tropical vacation. But when she runs into her ex and his new woman staying at the same resort, reason is washed out to sea. Caught off guard, Annie pretends she&#39;s with Chris, a cute screenwriter she meets on the beach. With his own writing blocked, Chris is happy to help Annie craft a story to save face. Soon Annie isn&#39;t just getting over her ex, she&#39;s getting under Chris. As her fictional feelings grow increasingly real, Annie has to decide if she&#39;s ready to risk her heart on a new relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Top Pick! &lt;i&gt;Almost a Bride&lt;/i&gt; put a smile on my face more than once. The dialogue was witty, the words were well-written and the heroine was one-of-a-kind.&quot; -- Harlequin Junkie" />
