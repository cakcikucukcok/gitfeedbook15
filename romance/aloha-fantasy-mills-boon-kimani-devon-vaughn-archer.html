  <title>Aloha Fantasy (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) - Devon Vaughn Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Award-winning photographer Danica Austin is the essence of urban chic. But with her love life going nowhere fast, she&#39;s more than ready to swap houses for a month in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The minute her plane touches down on exotic Hilo, Danica can&#39;t wait to check out the social scene and catch some breathtaking sunsets. Until gorgeous real estate investor Boyd Reed comes into the picture to stake his claim on the house…and her heart!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If this stunning stranger thinks she can just move into Boyd&#39;s jointly owned waterfront property, she can think again! Although he must admit: his temporary tenant is one irresistible woman. Sharing passion under tropical skies is making Boyd believe in the power of love. But Danica&#39;s not sure she wants to make Hawaii her home. If only he can just persuade her to spend the rest of her days and nights with him in their one-of-a-kind island paradise.…&lt;/p&gt;
