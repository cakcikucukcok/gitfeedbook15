  <title>Bond of Three - Emeke Obi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Onyekachi is a naturally shy boy, valiantly overcoming his own reluctance by acting like &quot;a man,&quot; extending his hand first, and greeting Njideka. Nneoma has other plans for him beyond shaking hands; she&#39;s arranged the meeting. Her scheme is beyond his comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affinity and closeness between Onyekachi and Nneoma has always been there. Closer than a brother and sister, the two grow up in the same village where they protect, nurture, and trust each otherdespite attending different schools. As Onyekachi and Nnemoa develop into adolescents, the virtuous Njideka joins and a perfect friendship begins. Together, the trio begins imagining their futures filled with beautiful and inspiring dreams. After Onyekachi begins to feel a stirring in his heart for Njideka, the two pledge their love to each other as Nneoma creates a plan for her own future. But it is not long before the three friends realize that making their dreams come true may be more difficult than they ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bond of Three&lt;/i&gt; narrates a poignant tale that captures the essence of Nigerian life and shares the memorable journey of three young adults who learn the everlasting value of true friendship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
