  <title>Children Born Into Love:  A Trio of Western Romances - Doreen Milstead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="And He Took The Children Into His Arms - A destitute woman in New York gives birth to a tiny baby and the orphanage there is unsure of the newborn&#39;s survival. After feeling that it&#39;s the baby&#39;s only chance for a good life, a friend of the orphanage takes the baby out to Indiana for adoption by a childless couple. This is the story of that little one and how she made her way through life and how she affected the couple that adopted her, with the help of the Lord.  Loretta&#39;s Orphanage Of Love, is about a pastor and his wife setting up an orphanage, and just as the first children are about to arrive on the train, a tragic event occurs which will change the pastor&#39;s life forever.  Alice&#39;s Many Children: A Mail Order Bride Romance - This is an incredibly moving story about love; love for people of another race, love for children with special needs, and love between a man and a woman--a surprise mail order bride--who can give nothing but kindness to all who surround them." />
