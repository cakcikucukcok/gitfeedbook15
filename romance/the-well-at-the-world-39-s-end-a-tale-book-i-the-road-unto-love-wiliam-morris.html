  <title>The Well at the World&#39;s End - A Tale - Book I: The Road Unto Love - Wiliam Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This vintage book contains the first volume of William Morris&#39;s 1896 novel, &quot;The Well at the World&#39;s End&quot;. It is a fantasy novel that, along with Morris&#39;s other work, &quot;The Wood Beyond the World&quot; (1894), inspired the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien. It is the story of Ralph of Upmeads, a son of a king who sets out, against his parents&#39; desires, to seek out the fabled &quot;Well at the World&#39;s End&quot;, a magical well that will give those who drink of it godlike powers. An enthralling and masterfully-written tale of fantasy and adventure, &quot;The Well at the World&#39;s End&quot; is highly recommended for fans of the genre, and it is not to be missed by collectors of Morris&#39;s work. William Morris (1834 - 1896) was an English poet, novelist, translator, and activist. Many texts such as this are increasingly hard to come by and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
