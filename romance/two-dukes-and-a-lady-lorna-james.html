  <title>Two Dukes and a Lady - Lorna James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charles Ashdown, Duke of Densmore, and his closest friend William Kenwood, Duke of Tennison, love gambling and womanizing too much to ever be ensnared by a debutante. Certainly, no decent wife would allow the debauchery they enjoy. But the only woman they&#39;ve ever loved has returned. Unfortunately, Society, and likely darling Lily, will never accept the sharing relationship they&#39;d like to propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lillian Drew returns to England after her husband&#39;s mysterious death and finds solace with her girlhood crushes, Charles and William. Sure, they&#39;re as unapologetically crass and self-centered as always, but she loves them both. When her dead husband&#39;s creditors come after her, she has no choice but to remarry, though she can&#39;t make up her mind which duke she&#39;ll propose to. With a toss of one of the few coins she has left to her name, she hopes the loser will understand.&lt;/p&gt;" />
