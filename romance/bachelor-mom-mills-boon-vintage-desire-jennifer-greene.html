        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;SINGLE MOM SEEKING EXCITEMENT &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being as straitlaced as a saint was getting Gwen Stanford absolutely nowhere. Just once she wanted to be positively wicked! So when Spense McKenna gave her a steamy kiss, she decided it was time to shake that good-girl image… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One minute Spense was asking his alluring neighbor for advice about his pint-size daughter, the next he was sweet-talking her into his arms. Sure, the thought of seducing Gwen had been on his mind from the first moment he&#39;d laid eyes on her, but suddenly seduction wasn&#39;t the only thing on his mind…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE STANFORD SISTERS: &lt;em&gt;Three sisters discover once-in-a-lifetime love and strengthen the bonds of family!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
