Only this time, he&#39;d be leaving behind Melinda Winston. From the moment they met, Drew and Melinda shared a connection he&#39;d never thought possible, thanks to his extraordinary&amp;mdash;and secret&amp;mdash;ability to self-heal. Now, with a baby on the way, Melinda needed protection, not a man trying to stay one step ahead. But after barely rescuing her from the hands of his enemies, Drew was ready to admit to his troubled past and its effect on their future. He knew self-healing was a powerful gift&amp;hellip;but the damage would be irreparable if he lost Melinda and his baby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
