  <title>Along Came Us - Nicole McLaughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He&#39;s Mr. Wrong, she&#39;s Miss Independent. When the two come together, sparks fly! Don&#39;t miss &lt;/i&gt;Along Came Us&lt;i&gt;, a sexy and heartwarming romance from Nicole McLaughlin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Guardsman Tyler Cavallo knows all too well what it feels like to be a volatile teenager. There was a time when it seemed like everyone--be it his father, a rival gang member, or his opponent in the MMA cage--was out to get him. These days he focuses that fight into his gym where he mentors at-risk youths. But one particular teen has Tyler more concerned than usual, and if he&#39;s learned one thing in life, it&#39;s to trust his instincts, and right now those instincts are telling him that this boy isn&#39;t safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lia Hanson is a woman on a mission. With bills to pay, and a younger brother to raise, and two full time jobs, she&#39;s working her ass off and doing the best she can. But in a few months she will finally graduate from college and be able to put most of that behind her for good. Or so she thinks, until a certain overbearing and stupidly good looking gym owner acts like he knows what&#39;s best for her brother. A man is the last thing she wants, and this man is certainly not who she pictured as a stable role model. Lia thought she had a plan, but Tyler&#39;s support, strength and passion have her realizing that sometimes the best things in life come when they&#39;re least expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
