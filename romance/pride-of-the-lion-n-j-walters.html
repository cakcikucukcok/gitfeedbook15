      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Araminta Davidson is invited to participate in a readers&#39; appreciation weekend, she feels like she&#39;s arrived as an author.

The woman who released him calls to his animal nature, and he realizes she&#39;s his mate. But is she as innocent as she seems, or was she sent by Hades? The clock is ticking, but not fast enough.
