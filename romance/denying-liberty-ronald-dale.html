  <title>Denying Liberty - Ronald Dale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1865, ten year old Veronique was allowed to attend a dinner party at her grandfathers home near Versailles, France.  At this affair, her grandfather proposed a gift for America that was destined to become the Statue of Liberty.   How could Veronique have ever known that, from that moment, her life and that of the statue would become intertwined for over three decades?  This is the story of Libertys and Veroniques  journeys to America.  Libertys arrival will precede that of Veroniques and while Liberty may have been rejected by Americans at first, she would eventually be welcomed by hundreds of thousands of people on the day of her unveiling. Fifteen years later in the year 1901,  Veronique certainly is not expecting such a welcoming. No, Veronique, with only her son, intends to enter America very quietly and with very questionable travel documentation. She is hopeful that her admittance into America will be allowed because of her special relationship with Liberty. And she is keenly aware that her entry into America could be blocked by her ancestral heritage  a secret which she must be careful not to reveal to the Immigration Inspector. Veronique arrives at Ellis Island intent on securing her passage into America by claiming she is the visage of Liberty  that she was, in fact, the model for the statue.  Immigration Inspector Patrick Leary is totally enthralled by her story; but ultimately he must decide is it believable? It will be his decision alone that determines whether America will be &lt;i&gt;Denying Liberty&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
