  <title>Ball Buster - Kara Sheridan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In Kara Sheridan&#39;s sexy new series, these hard-hitting pro footballers don&#39;t play by the book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In Kara Sheridan&#39;s sexy series, these hard-hitting pro footballers don&#39;t play by the book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Playbook Rule #1: Never &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; give up &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  It&#39;s official. The Alabama Warriors have the worst reputation in pro football. As the team&#39;s captain, Carson Savage has his ass on the line and - thanks to a leaked photo - his ass is also &lt;i&gt;online.&lt;/i&gt; Now the team is getting an image makeover from Sadie Reynolds, the hottest redhead in the South &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;Carson&#39;s high school sweetheart. Maybe making a play for his sexy ex is a risky move... but Carson didn&#39;t make it this far by playing it safe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Alabama is the last place in the world Sadie wants to be. Going home again only reminds her of what - and who - she gave up. Seeing the insanely hot ex she never quite forgot is dangerous. Carson&#39;s too sexy. Too tempting. And Sadie can&#39;t afford to go out of bounds. So she&#39;ll do whatever it takes to finish this job and leave town with her heart still intact. The only problem? Carson&#39;s decided it&#39;s not about winning the game... it&#39;s about winning the girl." />
