  <title>Dad Goes Deep - Elly Vee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anna&amp;#39;s mother finds her daughter&amp;#39;s panties drenched in semen. How can this be since her daughter isn&amp;#39;t allowed to date until her upcoming birthday? There&amp;#39;s only one man in her daughter&amp;#39;s life so it must be her husband. Little does Judith know that by accusing him she has put the idea of him being intimate with his only daughter in his head. Will Jason act on his urges now that his wife has left him after accusing him of the unthinkeble?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Her dad was sitting at the kitchen counter swirling a glass of scotch. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s going on?&amp;rdquo;: Anna asked. Jason looked up from his scotch apparently startled by Anna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, umm, &amp;lsquo;morning Anna.&amp;rdquo; Happy birthday, honey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s mom?&amp;rdquo; Anna asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, honey, but your mom and I had a huge fight last night. She went to stay at grandma&amp;rsquo;s house for a few days. &amp;ldquo;I thought you guys were decorating last night because I heard stumbling,&amp;rdquo; Anna said nervously. I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, honey that this is happening on your birthday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom had never walked out before so it must have been something bad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jason rubbed his forehead and started to whimper a little. Anna walked up to him to give him a hug but was stopped in her track as she noticed a crumpled up piece of cloth sitting on the counter next to Jason&amp;rsquo;s glass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s th...th...that?&amp;rdquo; Anna stuttered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jason let out a big sigh before he started talking. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no easy way to say this Anna, but your mom has the preposterous idea I&amp;#39;m having an affair with you. She found your panties hidden in the laundry basket. Your panties are drenched with sex, Anna. Care to explain this?&amp;rdquo;" />
