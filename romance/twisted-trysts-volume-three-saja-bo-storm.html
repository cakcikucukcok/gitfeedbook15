  <title>Twisted Trysts Volume Three - Saja Bo Storm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many of you who have previously read the first two volumes of Twisted Trysts know that the inside will reveal a collection of erotic short stories which will engage you in a delightful or delectable twist. To my readers who have not as yet read Twisted Trysts- Volume one or Twisted Trysts- Volume two, a tryst (pronounced Trist) is an agreement, esp. between lovers, to meet. These stories reveal the lifestyles of various characters with diverse cultural backgrounds, from different time zones and dissimilar philosophies about love. The one similarity is the fact that people have not really changed during these vast years. The human condition remains unaltered especially when a man and a woman are engaged in romantic entanglements or are in love. Each story presents the challenges of love and each tryst is set on a romantic stage of sensuality, desire and delight." />
