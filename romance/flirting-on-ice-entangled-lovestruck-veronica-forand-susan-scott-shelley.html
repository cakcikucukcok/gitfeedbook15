  <title>Flirting on Ice (Entangled Lovestruck) - Veronica Forand, susan scott shelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Professional hockey player Zac Elliott is in top form. He&#39;s having the best season of his career, the local fans can&#39;t get enough of him, and he&#39;s in the middle of the most successful contract negotiations of his career. When the sexy little spark between Zac and the team owner&#39;s daughter blazes to life, no matter how forbidden, he can&#39;t resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philanthropist Heather Ryan can&#39;t keep her hands off of Zac. If her father finds out, it could end Zac&#39;s career and ruin her reputation. What they share is deeply passionate and intensely private...until the press exposes their illicit relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the fans have viciously turned against Heather, Zac&#39;s game is faltering, and even his team has deserted him. The only way out of the penalty box is for Zac to play hockey like life--and love--depends on it...&lt;/p&gt;" />
