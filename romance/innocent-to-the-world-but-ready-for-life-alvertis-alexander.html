  <title>Innocent to the World but Ready for Life - Alvertis Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a young girl who has grown accustomed to the finer things in life, Samantha has never wanted for anything. Sheltered and privileged, she has no reason to believe that her life will ever be anything but comfortablebut she is about to learn a harsh lesson about the realities of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her parents are tragically killed in an accident, her life is uprooted. In the days following the accident, family secrets are uncovered. When Samantha learns that she was adopted, she is broken yet again. Now an orphan with no inheritance of home, she is left without a dime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her nanny, a woman who loved her more than her adopted parents did, takes her in. Together, they will face Samanthas new life with as much courage as they can muster. Samantha is an innocent to the ways of the world, but with the help of her devoted nanny, she will soon learn there is kindness and friendship available. She meets a young girl named Armani, and the two quickly bond, even though they are from different worlds. The pair become best friends as they grow into beautiful, confident, kind young women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their friendship is a beacon of hope in a world where differences tear too many lives apart. They prove that no matter your race, creed, or color, friendship is a powerful force in a world filled with hatred and fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, they make sure that they will be ready for whatever life throws their way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
