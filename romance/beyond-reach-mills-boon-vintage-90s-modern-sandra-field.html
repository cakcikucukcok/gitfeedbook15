  <title>Beyond Reach (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Sandra Field</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Significant Others Blondes were usually more fun… . &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Troy Donovan was proving to be the exception to the rule! He was tough, uncompromising and off-limits. He had no intention of letting anyone get close to him again. And that included Lucy - especially Lucy. He&#39;d made it clear that whatever her relaxed interpretation of her new job was, it didn&#39;t include bedroom duties. Lucy Barnes was a brunette… and as far as she was concerned she could make her own rules.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She may have traveled to the Caribbean on a whim but impulsiveness was only one of Lucy&#39;s weaknesses. The other was for tall blond men - and Troy was one of the sexiest she had ever met! He&#39;d told her he didn&#39;t believe in mixing business with pleasure… and that was fine with Lucy. Why let business get in the way of anything?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the author of WILDFIRE: &quot;Pure pleasure… &quot; - &lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
