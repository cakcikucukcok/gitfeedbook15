She served her country, but the experience left her emotionally numb and estranged from her career-military family. Staying in Independence Falls seems like the first step to reclaiming her life until the town playboy stumbles into her bed &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chad Summers is living his dream&amp;#8212;helicopter logging by day and slipping between the sheets with Mrs. Right Now by night. Until his wild nights threaten his day job, leaving Chad with a choice: prove he can settle down or kiss his dream goodbye. But when he ends up in the wrong bed, the one woman in Independence Falls he can&amp;#39;t touch offers a tempting proposition. Chad is ready and willing to give in to the primal desire to make Lena his at night&amp;#8212;on one condition. By day, they pretend their relationship is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their connection extends beyond the bedroom, threatening to turn their sham into reality if Chad can prove he&amp;#39;s the hero Lena needs night and day &amp;#8230; forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
