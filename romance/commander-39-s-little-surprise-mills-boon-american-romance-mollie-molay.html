  <title>Commander&#39;s Little Surprise (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Mollie Molay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A precious reminder of her one fall from grace…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Baranovian royal Victoria Bernard&#39;s cherished daughter had the same dimple and sparkling eyes as her father, a man forever forbidden to Victoria. She should never have seen him again–except she was assigned to diplomatic duty at Lieutenant Commander Dan O&#39;Hara&#39;s JAG post! She only hoped Dan would not recognize her…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dan was a commander with a five-year plan, with marriage and kids far off in the future. But something about Victoria reminded him of the mystery woman with whom he&#39;d spent one tantalizing night. It was crazy to think this off-limits royal might be her. Honor demanded he walk away–until he saw Victoria&#39;s baby girl, and his five-year plan became five seconds to fatherhood!&lt;/p&gt;
