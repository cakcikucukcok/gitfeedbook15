  <title>Hard to Come By - Laura Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Five dishonored soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;Former Special Forces.&lt;br /&gt;One last mission.&lt;br /&gt;These are the men of Hard Ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derek DiMarzio would do anything for the members of his disgraced Special Forces team&amp;#8212;sacrifice his body, help a former teammate with a covert operation to restore their honor, and even go behind enemy lines. He just never expected to want the beautiful woman he found there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a sexy stranger asks questions about her brother, Emilie Garza is torn between loyalty to the sibling she once idolized and fear of the war-changed man he&amp;#39;s become. Derek&amp;#39;s easy smile and quiet strength tempt Emilie to open up, igniting their desire and leading Derek to crave a woman he shouldn&amp;#39;t trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team&amp;#39;s investigation reveals how powerful their enemies are, Derek and Emilie must prove where their loyalties lie before hearts are broken and lives are lost. Because love is too hard to come by to let it slip away . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
