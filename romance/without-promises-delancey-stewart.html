  <title>Without Promises - Delancey Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Trent McNeil was a classic trust-fund kid until he watched a team of firefighters save his family home. From that moment on, he rebelled against the path his parents were determined to keep him on. Now a San Diego firefighter, he knows he&#39;ll eventually be expected to take over the family empire. But until that day, his only plan is to have fun and enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a childhood of upset and uncertainty, Amy Hodge is going to make something out of herself. She has her future all planned out. She&#39;s starting medical school and is going to be busy...far too busy for a relationship. But she does have time for a quick fling before she buckles down and concentrates on her studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy quickly realizes that playboy Trent is not all he seems to be. Never relinquishing control and sticking to her plans has done well for Amy, but no one has ever made her want to throw caution to the wind like this sexy firefighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Under the Pier series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Without Words&lt;br&gt;* Without Promises&lt;/p&gt;" />
