  <title>The Girl Who Lived with the Indians - Hampie Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sally rescued by the Comanche Indians, given the name Yacke-pete, finds herself adopted into a culture that lived in harmony with nature, honored the spirit, didnt believe in a punishing God, did not cover their nakedness and practiced polygamy. As a young maiden she falls in love with and is promised to Blue Sky, her Indian brother. When the soldiers find her, they insist on returning her to her white civilization. Forced back into her white world, she is always referred to as, &lt;i&gt;the girl who lived with the Indians. &lt;/i&gt;She will never give up her love for her Comanche people, her wild free spirit and her Indian ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She falls in love with and marries Martin a rancher, whom she will always love deeply, but Blue Sky is still her hearts love. Believing as her people that sex is a natural act shared between a woman and man, sometimes with feelings of love, sometimes with only the need for peace and comfort. She will try to divide her heart between the men she loves, but her heart cannot divide or subtract, it can only add and multiply. She believes, as the Indians that our life is decided by destiny, that we cannot fight it. It will lead us down a path that was decided before our birth into this world. We make choices but fate might turn it all around and lead us where we are to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a historical romance based on true events; one woman torn between two cultures must follow her heart to determine whether her choices will decide her destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
