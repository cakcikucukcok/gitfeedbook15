        &lt;p&gt;When politician Benedict Tawny set out to save Lady Alyssa from a nefarious plot, he never expected to find himself trapped in a compromising situation with the alluring lady! Now duty demands he propose…and claim her as his bride!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tainted by his illegitimacy, Ben knows he can’t give Alyssa the life of luxury she deserves. But if he can convince her to succumb to the undeniable heat between them, their convenient marriage might just lead to the love of a lifetime!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Earl of Shalford needs to marry into money to save his estate. Wealthy and beautiful Henrietta Buxted should be the perfect candidate. So why does his eye keep wandering to her quiet cousin Charlotte Wyncroft?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Charlotte watches Henrietta&#39;s games of courtship with wry amusement. That is, until a stolen dance reveals a hidden side to the earl. Penniless Charlotte knows she’s far from a suitable match yet, in Adam&#39;s arms, she can dream of the happily-ever-after she’s always wanted!&lt;/p&gt;
