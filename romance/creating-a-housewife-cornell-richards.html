      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-eight-year-old Clayton Jones is a wealthy day trader, and after years of dating shallow and uptight rich women, he becomes sick and tired of the bachelor life. However, hes more sickened by the majority of society downplaying the possibility of a promiscuous woman being able to be transformed into a respectable housewife. He decides to take equal opportunity to the extreme and intentionally goes on a massive hunt looking for a whore who has the best potential to be a wife.
During Claytons pursuit to prove society wrong by finding true love with a promiscuous woman and provide her with a more authentic lifestyle, hes supported by two longtime male friends from college. After tremendous failure and mockery from both encounters and associates, new light is shed during the uphill battle due to his persistence. But the real challenge begins after his careful selection is made and he migrates to the suburbs with his significant other, whos now struggling to maintain a great friendship with her old friends and trying to fit in as a new suburban housewife. When push comes to shove and Clayton has financial difficulty, his wife is placed in a predicament whether to use her street mentality and save her family, all while shattering the hopes and dreams of Claytons pursuit of happiness, or suffer in financial ruins and be thrown out on the street.
A novella that submits a fresh concept of true love being found in all forms if the right opportunity is provided, which comes from a males perspective, Creating a Housewife provides the true meaning of equal opportunity." />
