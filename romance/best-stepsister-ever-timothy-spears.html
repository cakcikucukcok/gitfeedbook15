  <title>Best Stepsister Ever - Timothy Spears</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
The first time Carl saw his stepsister masturbating, it was the most erotic sight he&amp;rsquo;d ever laid eyes on. She laid on her bed, oblivious to his presence, her hand sliding inside her jeans. Her other hand roamed underneath her tank top. Her cheeks were flushed and rubbed against her bare shoulders as she squirmed over the covers. He&amp;rsquo;d come home not ten minutes ago from his dentist appointment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
He wasn&amp;rsquo;t really surprised at his reaction. Most people think the default setting for the human body is non-arousal; most people are incorrect. In actuality, the norm is arousal. The brain actually secretes an enzyme that tells the rest of the body, &amp;ldquo;Do not be aroused! Do not be aroused!&amp;rdquo; When we get turned on, that&amp;rsquo;s because our brains have halted that enzyme, allowing the normal state of arousal to return. And with a 22-year-old male, that enzyme was produced even less than normal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Besides, Lauren was beautiful. Long, auburn hair that flowed just below her shoulders, big brown eyes, and a smooth olive complexion. At 21, she had a natural beauty and a body that rivaled any girl Carl had seen in real life. Supermodels and actresses didn&amp;rsquo;t count, by his standards. But she was normally so prudish. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just seeing her like this that excited him so much. It was the fact that masturbation was the last thing he had ever expected to find her doing. She always wrinkled her nose at any talk of sex. So, despite her good looks and physique, Carl never really thought of her as a sexual being.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As he watched, her pace quickened, and a soft panting escaped her lips. Carl&amp;rsquo;s cock bulged against his jeans, and he flirted with playing with himself right there outside her door. Instead, he adjusted his package.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her panting became more fevered and immediate. Her hips began to rock against her buried hand, and the one under her shirt descended to her waistline, tugging distractedly at her pants. It was like she wanted and yet didn&amp;rsquo;t want to take them off. Her tugging had lowered them slightly, revealing the edges of her hips and exposing her smooth tummy. Her free hand quickly popped the button and unzipped the fly, then joined the first. She now had both hands working herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes were closed, lids fluttering passionately, and she was biting her lip, her tiny little moans tickling Carl to a raging hard-on. She was the picture of sexy, so sultry and evocative, that Carl wanted nothing more than to join her. But he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to embarrass her or himself. And he was enjoying his peep show far too much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her rocking hips began to thrust harder, and her brow furrowed, her face scrunching up in ecstasy. Her head fell back on the bed, her mouth hanging open, frozen in a silent cry of delight. Her back arched up into the air, and she looked almost in pain for instant, before the breath that was caught in her chest escaped in a heaving, trembling moan that sent shivers through Carl&amp;rsquo;s entire body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lauren&amp;rsquo;s orgasm quivered through her body, her bottom lip trembling, her eyes held shut as she settled back down on the bed, her hands still working inside her jeans, but slower and more gently. She cooed against her shoulders, shivering briefly. And then she spoke for the first time since Carl had stumbled upon her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, Carl&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
