  <title>Sweet Southern Betrayal - Robin Covington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sweet Southern Betrayal: A Boys Are Back in Town Novel by Robin Covington&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waking up in a tacky Elvis-themed bedroom is a bad sign--even in Vegas. Especially when it&#39;s accompanied by five-star hangover and no memory of the night before. For golden-boy lawyer Teague Elliott, it&#39;s the kind of nightmare that could ruin his political career before it&#39;s even begun. Especially if it&#39;s the kind of trouble that&#39;s sleeping in his bed...with creamy skin, flaming hair, and a voice that evokes the memory of seriously &lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;unbelievable&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt; sex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least there&#39;s no ring on his finger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Showgirl Risa Clay is in &lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;way&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt; over her head. She had her instructions: seduce Teague, marry him, and hand the &quot;evidence&quot; over to her mobster boss for blackmail. But somehow, the plan went awry--starting with the five rounds of wickedly-hot sexy time with Teague. Now Risa&#39;s running for her life... and the only man who can possibly help her is the man whose career she&#39;s about to destroy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
