      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ellie Maitland was goal-oriented. She operated on five-year plans. Finishing her master&#39;s degree by night, serving as chief administrator at her family&#39;s renowned clinic by day, she was out to prove herself, big time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sloan Cassidy had eighteen-month-old twin daughters, and not a clue in the world how to handle them since his wife had left. But he knew who did.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No way was Ellie going to let herself be roped into helping to care for Sloan&#39;s little girls. Those kids brought out all the maternal instincts she wanted to suppress. And she had no time. And Sloan was &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too appealing. And everyone knew the cowboy had broken her heart ten years ago. Except Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;
