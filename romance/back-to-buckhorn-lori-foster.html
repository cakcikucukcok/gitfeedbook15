  <title>Back to Buckhorn - Lori Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Lori Foster comes a sizzling new Buckhorn Brothers novella&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For odd-girl-out Zoey Hodge, the best thing about Buckhorn, Kentucky, was leaving it behind. And now she&#39;s back–at least until she can nurse her mother back to health and hightail it out of there anew. But there&#39;s one person she doesn&#39;t mind seeing again. Garrett Hudson was one of the few who was always kind to her. Now he&#39;s a firefighter–still one of the good guys, but with a sexy alpha charm that&#39;s tempting her inner bad girl.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In school, Zoey was smart, witty and unafraid to be herself. Garrett fell hard back then, and he&#39;s falling even faster now. As far as he&#39;s concerned, there are all kinds of reasons Zoey should stick around. Her pet grooming business. Her mom. And the chance for him to prove that he can be her real-life hero in every way that matters….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Look for more titles in the Buckhorn Brothers series, available now from Lori Foster and Harlequin HQN: &lt;em&gt;Buckhorn Beginnings, Forever Buckhorn, The Buckhorn Legacy&lt;/em&gt; and the novella &quot;Buckhorn Ever After&quot; in the &lt;em&gt;Animal Attraction&lt;/em&gt; anthology.&lt;/strong&gt;
