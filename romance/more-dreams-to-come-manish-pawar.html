  <title>More Dreams to Come - Manish Pawar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you believe in DREAMS??
If you have one, what would you do to fulfill it?
This question stands in front everyone when we are questioned about our DREAMS.
DREAMS that make us live just like Dhruv, who, dreams to become an Animator someday. 
He plans things accordingly and along the path he makes many friends. But falling in love was never in the list. So what happens when he falls in love with two girls at one time? Will he ever be able to get out of his confusion to understand the one who truly loves him? Whether it&#39;s Mahi or Radhika? 
By the time he finds out, everything is over and he is left alone. With all his confidence lost he lands up being a faculty for NIIT to teach Programing languages. So will he be able to teach? 
And like he always says History Repeats Itself in various forms. Will he have friends to support him? Or will he be left alone? What about his dream to be an Animator?
Find out the unsaid things of his life in MORE DREAMS TO COME..." />
