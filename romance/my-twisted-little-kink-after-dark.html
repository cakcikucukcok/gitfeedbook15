  <title>My Twisted Little Kink - After Dark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A reformed philandering baseball player finds sexual delight in watching other men fuck his women, including his wife Sandy who &amp;ldquo;secretly&amp;rdquo; hooks up with her ex Simeon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I should&amp;rsquo;ve known then something was up. Fishy, not what it seemed. I had no doubt. Not hanging over my head from the likes of goons, especially these goons. I owed nothing more than a small supplemental loan I got from the bank, and even that was a few weeks off from repayment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other thing&amp;ndash;in spite of my plea of not knowing what they were talking about&amp;ndash;was the eerie feeling which crept over me, like I was all too familiar with the masculine bodies that filled the tight space of the bedroom. As if I had seen them all before, in all their stark naked glory, somehow; strangely even with water cascading down their hard frames in place of the sweat building up on their taut fleshes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even more telling&amp;ndash;this, of course, in hindsight no less&amp;ndash;her feeble attempt to resist the men. Not as if it was futile to resist her attackers because she was the &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; woman and they were too big and too many for her to fend off. No. It was the subtle look of ecstasy in her eyes; the wanting to call out her pleasure after the first guy broke his stride. Her writhing wildly atop the mattress like a possessed succubus gyrating her hips against her partnered assailants. Her low beastly groans growing stronger and stronger by the minute begging for more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My body&amp;rsquo;s betraying me,&amp;rdquo; she cried out to me. Telling me their ridiculously huge pricks were filling her up to the brim, and every time another guy came, another small death washed over her only to be awakened by the newest hard-on plowing into her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was too busy crying in my chair, pleading for them to stop in my helpless state, especially when I saw one guy still inside her dare to go for a double hitter. The bastards cheered as he dumped his duplicitous load against her convulsing quim. Fuck! No! The men agreed, &amp;ldquo;The hungry slut&amp;rdquo; was enjoying herself wayyy too much for them to stop, inspiring new erections which kept them taking turns throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I cried some more. She came like a lioness. Her sweat-drenched body &amp;ldquo;betraying&amp;rdquo; her orgasm after fervent orgasm&amp;ndash;or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the men left, she limped out of bed towards me like a dizzying drunk. Maybe this too was an act. Maybe this was for real, with her legs consistently spread open for five virile men for hours on end. To this day, I do not know. I do know the closer she got to me, her ersatz weeping grew into a sadistic cackle as her warm cunt hovered over my lap with their collected deposits as she gave her stretched pussy one solid push to release a beige glob. She the confessed the plunder I witnessed was just an elaborate rouse put on by her and some of my teammates as payback for me fucking her mom and her aunt in the Jacuzzi at Thanksgiving." />
