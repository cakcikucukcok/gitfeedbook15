  <title>Virgin Island - Dr. Michael Nicolas Wundah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Virgin Island is a romantic fiction, which represents a book within a book. Two passengers  a male and a female meet on board a plane flying from the Lungi International Airport in Freetown, Sierra Leone to London and then from London to China. The female passenger is eager to share the romantic novel Virgin Island with someone. Luckily, she succeeds in luring the male passenger into listening to her read the whole book throughout their flight until they reach their destination. Virgin Island revolves around two main characters. They are a handsome and generous British Colonial District Commissioner of Virgin Island, named Teddy Bear and a young indigenous diva, Lucy, affectionately known as the Queen of Virgin Island. After years of rollercoaster life, the DC finally finds the love of his life in Lucy on this most beautiful and popular island in the Southern region of Sierra Leone. In less than a year, unbelievably, the couple marry marked by a display of wealth, pomp and pageant but their relationship suffers frustration due to anxieties and worries over childbearing setbacks. Amidst all the drama, independence comes to Sierra Leone; DC Teddy Bears period of engagement on Virgin Island is over. The anxiety and drama escalates. Will the DC take Lucy with him to England or not? The story ends happily when the couple eventually leave for England. Naturally as the two passengers enjoy the book throughout their flight, they too, like the two main characters in the book are fated. Will they too fall in love on their journey or when they get to their destination in China? If it happens, is it by chance, did fate intervene? This is the climax of Virgin Island." />
