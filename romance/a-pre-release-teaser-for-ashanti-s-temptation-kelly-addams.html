  <title>A Pre-Release Teaser for - Ashanti’s Temptation - Kelly Addams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A Pre-Release Teaser for - Ashanti&amp;rsquo;s Temptation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ashanti&amp;rsquo;s Temptation is a novel based on the story Peninah&amp;rsquo;s Passion by Andy Lang. Collaborating with the original author I have rewritten large sections and turned the main protagonist Ashanti (formerly Peninah) from a well meaning and confused wife who fights tooth and nail to resist temptations, into a well meaning and confused slut who embraces the temptations around her, driven by a kinky streak a mile wide she still debates her dubious choices, but also embraces the naughty demons that drive her.&lt;br /&gt;
This is an excerpt from the middle of the story; Ashanti, through a twist of fate is forced into the arms of Diego, her secret Spanish lover while her husband Alex is in hospital following an accident. A confirmed exhibitionist she explores her fetish to the extreme, then discovers that her sexual attraction isn&amp;rsquo;t just toward men!&lt;br /&gt;
The full book is due for publication on 25/12/2018, so please check your favourite online retailers and get your pre-order in as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for downloading this excerpt, and if you enjoy Ashanti&amp;rsquo;s naughty adventures in this short sample&amp;hellip; then you are going to love the full story." />
