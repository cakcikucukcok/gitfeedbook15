All she wants now is a home of her own where she and Kayla can finally feel safe. With one bad marriage behind her, she can&#39;t even dream of falling in love again. Until she meets Richard...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tall, handsome veterinarian with a warm smile and big heart, Richard Youngblood is the kind of man any woman could fall for. Not only does he have a wonderful way with animals, he&#39;s great with little Kayla and--Naomi has to admit--he&#39;s easy on the eyes. Richard definitely has his sights set on her, too. But first, Naomi has to free herself from her past--and learn how to love again--before she can have all she ever wanted with the man of her dreams...&lt;/p&gt;" />
