  <title>Sexually Transmitted Desire - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Faelhanu invasion went all but unnoticed by humanity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At least, in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To uplift humanity, changes had to be made in their genetic makeup. And the best way to spread that change was through lots and lots of sex. Luckily, the Faelhanu were up to the task. Watch as the residents of one quiet suburban neighborhood succumb to the joys of &amp;quot;Sexually Transmitted Desire!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lauren slowly walked across the damp grass, unaware of the fact that her nostrils were flared, her eyes wide and dilated, and that her inner core was pulsing with desire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pressing down on the doorbell, she heard a chime from inside the house. When nothing happened after a few moments, she rang it again. And when nothing continued to happen, she held her finger down on the bell, hearing it ring over and over and over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;All right!&amp;quot; An irritated voice hollered from inside the house, followed by the sound of feet descending a staircase.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The inner door was yanked open, and Albert&amp;#39;s face frowned at her. His hair was wet, plastered to his head, and he wore only a towel, one hand keeping it from slipping off his hips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lauren swore that she had only meant to tell him that his windows were open, and then leave for home. But what came out of her mouth was something completely different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know you screwed Mom tonight. I&amp;#39;ve got better tits, though.&amp;quot; She lifted the hem of her tight t-shirt, smiling in pride as her breasts sprang out from behind the restraining cloth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Want to screw me?&amp;quot;" />
