  <title>Blood and Fire - Shannon McKenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Restless and impulsive, Bruno Ranieri fits right in with the McClouds. And just like the McCloud brothers, Bruno has a dangerous past to contend with--one that&#39;s about to come crashing back into his life.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruno is working hard to keep his nose clean and save the family business. Not easy when the nightmares that plagued his childhood are hi-jacking what little rest he gets. Even harder when beautiful fugitive Lily Parr appears, on the run from assassins--and implying that Bruno is involved. But the violence that accompanies her is no illusion. Nor is the blisteringly hot desire that explodes between them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After her father&#39;s suspicious death, and an attempt on her own life, snippets of information have led Lily to Bruno&#39;s door.  .  .and his charisma soon compels her into his bed. But with killers on her heels, running won&#39;t help--not with the terrifying secret lurking in Bruno and Lily&#39;s pasts. A secret their mysterious enemy will gladly destroy them to protect.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;McKenna strikes gold again.&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Her books will take readers on a nonstop thrill ride and leave them begging for more when the last pages are devoured.&quot; &amp;#8211;Maya Banks, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Edgy, erotic, and breathtaking.&quot; &amp;#8211;Maya Banks" />
