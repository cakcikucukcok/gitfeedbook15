  <title>Religion Is God’S Way of Showing Us It’S a Lot Earlier in Human Evolution Than We Thought - Douglas Falknor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Radical understanding of ourselves is now possible to our very coregreater insight into whom we really are, where we came from, what our evolution has been, what it has meant, and what it means now and for the future. That quest has been an intellectual one, but it also has been a spiritual oneand answers with spiritual meaning are now possible, even for the atheists, doubters, skeptics, humanists, and freethinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, author Douglas Falknor explores the issue of how religion has evolved along with humanity. A nonbeliever, Falknor seeks to answer a host of age-old questions: Are we born addicted to religion? Why do we have religion? Is there a God? How has religion evolved and created the hardwired spirituality within us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falknor goes beyond the God gene and surveys recent thought and reveals original interpretations of what it all means. He traces this spiritual quest for nonbelievers and calls this the Path of the Doubtful Sojourner. Through this discussion, Falknor seeks to pave the way toward greater spiritual and psychological fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
