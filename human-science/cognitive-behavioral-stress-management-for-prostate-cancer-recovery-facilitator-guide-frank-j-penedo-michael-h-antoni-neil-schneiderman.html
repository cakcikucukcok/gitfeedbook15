  <title>Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management for Prostate Cancer Recovery Facilitator Guide - Frank J. Penedo, Michael H. Antoni, Neil Schneiderman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Men treated for localized prostate cancer have an excellent medical prognosis, but may have difficulty readjusting to life after surgery as a result of treatment related side effects. Changes in physical functioning and ongoing PSA monitoring due to the possibility of recurrence may bring added stress. Effective stress management is a key factor in increasing quality of life in this population and may play a role in maintaining overall health.   Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) and relaxation training constitute the two components of this comprehensive program. Each session provides participants with stress management skills, including cognitive restructuring, coping strategies, and social support. Participants practice a variety of relaxation methods, such as progressive muscle relaxation, imagery, and meditation.  Relevant issues for men having had prostate cancer, such as sexuality and communication, are also addressed.   This guide is designed to be used in conjunction with the corresponding workbook, which includes in-session exercises, monitoring forms, and homework assignments.  Group meetings combined with home practice facilitate the application of effective stress management and relaxation techniques to the everyday lives of participants.  Together, the guide and workbook include all the material and information needed to successfully implement this program.
