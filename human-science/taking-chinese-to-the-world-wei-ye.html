  <title>Taking Chinese to the World - Wei Ye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book the author explores the work and living experiences of Confucius Institute Chinese teachers (CICTs) in the UK, how they interpret and make sense of their sojourning experience, and how this context and the wider globalised social environment have impacted on their understandings and their personal growth. Because of their betwixt and between situation, the CICTs’ stories differ from those of other immigrants, international students and pre-service student teachers, who have been the main focus in L2 identity research. The book offers new insights into the Confucius Institutes (CI) with real life stories from teachers drawn from blogs, interviews and focus groups, drawing attention in the process to weaknesses of the CI programme and offering suggestions for ways forward which will be of interest to both stakeholders and those responsible for future international exchange programmes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
