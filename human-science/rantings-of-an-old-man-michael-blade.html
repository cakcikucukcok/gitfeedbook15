  <title>Rantings of an Old Man - Michael Blade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written for all of you who remain in perpetual fear of expressing yourselves when it comes to the things that effect your lives: things that you hate to see, hear, and feel; things that constantly prevent you from living your lives the way you want to live them; things that you yearn to voice your opinion about but dont because of the politically correct stick that you have allowed the world to stick up your ass. 
Lucky you! Im here to rescue you. Rantings Of An Old Man will say for you the things you are not willing to say for yourself. Of course, many who read this book will hate me and practically everything I say. Whats more, they will brand me as being the king of bigots. But, you know whatif that turns out NOT to be the case, than I will have failed in my mission. And the thought of that scares me because it will indicate that my book was not pithy enough, truthful enough, and relevant enough to make a difference in their lives. (That includes your life as well.) 
Do yourself a favor, go to the Foreword of this book and look at the last page which I have entitled, Table Of Rantings. There you will find listed the veritable plethora of topics I cover in the book. From that you will know right away whether or not this book is for you. 
A word to the wise: If your legs quiver whenever you see the f-word written, or if your hands begin to shake and/or your eyes begin to well every time you hear something negative about your own personal or political philosophy, your political party, or your race, then I suggest you refrain from reading this book. 
Make your move, pilgrim." />
