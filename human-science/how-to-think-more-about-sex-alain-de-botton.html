  <title>How to Think More About Sex - Alain De Botton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THE SCHOOL OF LIFE IS DEDICATED TO EXPLORING LIFE&#39;S BIG QUESTIONS IN HIGHLY-PORTABLE PAPERBACKS, FEATURING FRENCH FLAPS AND DECKLE EDGES, THAT THE NEW YORK TIMES CALLS &quot;DAMNABLY CUTE.&quot; WE DON&#39;T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT WE WILL DIRECT YOU TOWARDS A VARIETY OF USEFUL IDEAS THAT ARE GUARANTEED TO STIMULATE, PROVOKE, AND CONSOLE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We don&#39;t think too much about sex; we&#39;re merely thinking about it in the wrong way.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;So asserts Alain de Botton in &lt;i&gt;How to Think More About Sex&lt;/i&gt;, a rigorous and supremely honest book designed to help us navigate the intimate and exciting---yet often confusing and difficult---experience that is sex. Few of us tend to feel we&#39;re entirely normal when it comes to sex, and what we&#39;re supposed to be feeling rarely matches up with the reality. This book argues that twenty-first-century sex is ultimately fated to be a balancing act between love and desire, and adventure and commitment. Covering topics that include lust, fetishism, adultery, and pornography, Alain de Botton frankly articulates the dilemmas of modern sexuality, offering insights and consolation to help us think more deeply and wisely about the sex we are, or aren&#39;t, having.&lt;/p&gt;" />
