  <title>Consumed by One Another - D.S. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The black struggle is not our enemy, it is our strength. We must each take ownership of, and be accountable for, our daily lives in order to stop the downward slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When blacks, whites, and others fight each other, it only distracts us from enemies that do not discriminate in how they destroy human life. The bigger picture involves us as Americans more so than what color we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.S. Walker tells inspiring stories about personal triumphs, conflicts, and he also shares the concerns he has about whats holding back the black community. Along the way, he considers important questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
Are we ready to commit ourselves to what we need to do to get out of our present situation?&lt;/br&gt; 
Have we abandoned our moral mission and moved farther away from our moral center?&lt;/br&gt; 
Can the black community give its suffering positive and lasting meaning by how it responds to it?&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our children are watching us. What one generation accepts, the next generation will embrace. Our legacy is in question. Without deep thought, difficult conversations and a commitment to change, well continue to be &lt;i&gt;Consumed by One Another.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
