  <title>The Authority of Experience - John  C. O&#39;Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sensationism, a philosophy that gained momentum in the French Enlightenment as a response to Lockean empiricism, was acclaimed by Hippolyte Taine as &amp;quot;the doctrine of the most lucid, methodical, and French minds to have honored France.&amp;quot; The first major general study in English of eighteenth-century French sensationism, &lt;em&gt;The Authority of Experience&lt;/em&gt; presents the history of a complex set of ideas and explores their important ramifications for literature, education, and moral theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study begins by presenting the main ideas of sensationist philosophers Condillac, Bonnet, and Helv&amp;eacute;tius, who held that all of our ideas come to us through the senses. The experience of the body in seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching enabled individuals, as John C. O&#39;Neal points out, to challenge the sometimes arbitrary authority of institutions and people in positions of power. After a general introduction to sensationism, the author develops a theory of sensationist aesthetics that not only reveals the interconnections of the period&#39;s philosophy and literature but also enhances our awareness of the forces at work in the French novel. He goes on to examine the relations between sensationism and eighteenth-century French educational theory, materialism, and &lt;em&gt;id&amp;eacute;ologie&lt;/em&gt;. Ultimately, O&#39;Neal opens a discussion of the implications of sensationist thought for issues of particular concern to society today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
