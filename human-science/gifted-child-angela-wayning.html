  <title>Gifted Child - Angela Wayning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many parents wonder about their gifted children. They wonder where their intelligence came from, or why they behave the way they do. For example, many gifted children can be bossy or act as if they are adults, with their wits and words, while still showing immature behavior of a 4-year-old, or whatever their age is. This puzzles parents, and answers need to be given.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book does just that. Along with the topics mentioned above, this book also touches on the correlation between early birth and intelligence, the depressive thoughts some gifted children have, the meaning of IQ tests in these analyses, and the question about whether your child should skip a grade or not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trust me, these facts may surprise you. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on them." />
