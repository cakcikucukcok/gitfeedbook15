  <title>Reason with Compassion - Glenn M. Hardie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been written as a kind of primer in humanistic thought for the benefit of others who, like myself, are not profound scholars of philosophy or religion. All of the information in this book came from readily available sources, such as public lectures, libraries, and bookstores. It is directed towards ordinary people who have to work at other things for a living, and who thus may not have the time, money, facility, or inclination to permit extensive and detailed study of matters pertaining to humanism.
The book is also directed towards that vast and rapidly increasing number of humans who do not subscribe to any particular religion, and who may find in this book the expression of their own developed or latent humanism. Many people are simply not aware of the lengthy existence and growing significance of the Humanist Movement. They may be relieved to discover, as I was, that they are not alone, and to know that a channel exists into which they may direct their thoughts, energies, and support, if they should so choose to assist in improving the only world in which we all have to live." />
