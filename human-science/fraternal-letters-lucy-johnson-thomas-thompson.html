  <title>Fraternal Letters - Lucy Johnson Thomas Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was inspired by one of my grandsons, Eugene, to write a book after I had assisted him with making one. Being that the last fourteen years I had spent teaching preschoolers, I had viewed and read books on letters. I saw a need to create one with a different and interesting title. I knew you could alter a few letters to create other letters. However, while pondering that idea, I learned that every letter could be altered to create another letter. So the thought about twins come in twos or doubles. That thought led to the title Fraternal Letters. I created the book and thought I would have enjoyed having such a book in my room to teach letter recognition to my three-, four-, and five-year-olds had it been available. I read the book to two grandsons and had a granddaughter read it with positive feedback. That led to the idea of publication." />
