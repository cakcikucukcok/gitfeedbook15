  <title>Kinsey is Wrong! - PhD Barry Joel Kaplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, Dr. Kaplan experienced a traumatic life-changing event. This altered his perspective on sexuality and ultimately impacted the direction of his life. When Dr. Kaplan received his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in architecture and structural engineering from the University of Illinois, he reassessed his academic interests and pursued a career in clinical psychology. He earned his master&amp;rsquo;s degree from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. from Saybrook Institute in Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After treating many gay men in his clinical practice, Dr. Kaplan designed an FDA approved medical vacuum pump for penis enlargement and erectile dysfunction. As a successful businessman, he spent much of his life interviewing gay, bisexual, and straight men. Over the course of his adult life, Dr. Kaplan developed eye-opening and out-of-the-box conclusions regarding sexual orientation. Many of his theories are controversial and directly contradict many sex researchers and experts. This includes Alfred Charles Kinsey who was the pioneer and number one sex researcher of the 20th century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Straight, gay, and bisexual people are represented in all walks of life, across all nationalities, among all backgrounds, religions, and socio-economic classes. A person&amp;#39;s sexual orientation is fixed, distinct, and black-and-white. Among human beings, there is no continuum between straights, bisexuals, and gays. Circumstances may impact their sexual behavior, but not their sexual orientation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barry Joel Kaplan offers a groundbreaking and controversial interpretation of human sexuality, which many would consider to be politically incorrect. According to Dr. Kaplan, sexual orientation and identity is the fundamental component in defining and understanding human sexuality. Sexual behavior is secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kaplan&amp;#39;s analysis of sexual orientation directly challenges Alfred Kinsey&amp;#39;s continuum theory. His research-based conclusions are eye-opening interpretations of heterosexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality. His perspectives are inspired by many years of personal experiences and professional research which he shares with his readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
