  <title>Increasing Human Efficiency in Business / A Contribution to the Psychology of Business - Walter Dill Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We&amp;#39;ve built machines to become more efficient in business, but humans remain human -- and inefficient. But must that always be the case? According to renowned business psychologist Walter Dill Scott, managers can help workers find their &amp;quot;second wind,&amp;quot; the point at which they move past their previous limits and achieve top performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Applying psychology to business, Scott wrote, &amp;quot;when a man is doing what he believes to be his best, he is still able to do better; when he is completely exhausted, he is, under proper stimulus, able to continue.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Increasing Human Efficiency in Business, Scott explores how to create motivation for success. He looks at factors such as imitation, competition, loyalty, concentration, wages, pleasure, &amp;quot;the love of the game,&amp;quot; relaxation, and habit formation. He hopes to find each worker&amp;#39;s latent powers and hidden stores of energy to discover &amp;quot;wider horizons of honorable and profitable activity.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WALTER DILL SCOTT applied psychology to the fields of advertising, vocational aptitude, and business. He created a rating scale that would predict a job applicant&amp;#39;s success in a given position; this scale was modified for the military during World War I with great success. For this contribution, Scott earned a Distinguished Service Medal at the end of the war. He retired as President Emeritus from Northwestern University, which he led from 1920 -1939.&lt;br /&gt;
