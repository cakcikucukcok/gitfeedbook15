  <title>The Summation of Elohim - Deick Condrad Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;God made the universe simplistic; man made the understanding of the universe complicated. &lt;/i&gt;
The modern world has so many theoriesso many voices expounding on how the universe began, how it works, and how it may endits no wonder there is mass confusion that can end in miscommunication, hatred, and war. On deeper examination of the facts, however, we find that all these theories and voices have more in common than they believe. In &lt;i&gt;The Summation of Elohim,&lt;/i&gt; author Deick Conrad Williams simplifies and unifies societal beliefs of science and spiritualitythe beliefs of our civilizationand shows how understanding our universe on a new level helps us understand our relationship to God, to each other, and to ourselves.
Williams, a philosopher and mathematician who has devoted his life to studying the workings of the universe though the lens of numerous disciplines, first explores the universes beginnings, the advent of humanity, and how organized religion allowed civilization to flourish. Then, with minimal mathematical equations and ample analogies to modern life, Williams offers fresh, valuable insights on the algorithms governing our universeand the chaos inherent to its existence. 
From exploring the chakras and how to produce multiple orgasms to the Freudian id manifest in the seven deadly sins, &lt;i&gt;The Summation of Elohim&lt;/i&gt; takes an enlightening journey toward understanding our universe and our vital role within it.&lt;p&gt;
NOTE TO READER: This book does not need to be read cover to cover. Find a part of the book in the table of contents that sounds interesting and start from there." />
