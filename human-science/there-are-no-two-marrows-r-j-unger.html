  <title>There Are No Two Marrows - R. J. Unger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“There Are No Two Marrows” explores, with great humour, a real modern-day dilemma. Archie, a somewhat eccentric retired coal miner with traditional northern passions and pastimes, informs his family, out of the blue, that he intends to take his own life and wants their help in celebrating it. The story traces his reasons, the impact of his decision on his dysfunctional family life, the reaction of the community and the realisation that the best-laid plans are not guaranteed success. Within a background of innocence, fun, personal dilemmas and Christian beliefs the nature of relationships are scrutinized by exploring a range of diverse, often odd, characters." />
