  <title>The Truth About Reality - Anti Christ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for you! Anti Christ introduces you to yourself, your government and to your god. People, from all walks of life and religion, wonder about the validity of religion. Are physical creatures eternal beings cast in a prison of flesh or did life accidentally spring forth from the absurd and incoherent twists and turns of evolution?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The several kinds of reality this book introduces fill the voids of understanding about reality with real knowledge. The book is not about religion, spirituality, occult, or anything concretely physical. It encompasses all the deceitful control schemes laid on you like obedient dogs in their traces. You cannot afford to stay ignorant for your continued existence depends on knowing what and who you are physically and spiritually.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mysteries of life are caused by your belief systems. To believe means that you do not know. Belief is the portal to hell, the permanent state of living death; knowledge is the portal to reality and eternal life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Science and religion cannot give the insight this book brings. Whether you believe the material is for you, or not, you cannot afford to remain ignorant for the route back to true reality is made clear. Ignorance always portrays itself as brilliance. The world is full of brilliant pretenders.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My brother, Anti Christ leads you from example to example to understand the hoax on which physical reality is based. The more real life seems the more you are betrayed and trapped. The greatest mystery in the mind is the mystery of yourself. Vaguely, you all believe to be strangers guilty of something not understood.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anti Christ gives you the better outlook on life than any ideology, ism or cult you now subscribe to. Through believing clever deceits mankind never saw physical awareness for what it is. What humanity endlessly searches for lies revealed in the pages of this book. It overrules all human and, so-called, godly knowledge. I could not have said it better. Make it yours.
