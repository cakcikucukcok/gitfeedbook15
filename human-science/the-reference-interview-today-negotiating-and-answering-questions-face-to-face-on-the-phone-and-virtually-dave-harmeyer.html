  <title>The Reference Interview Today: Negotiating and Answering Questions Face to Face, on the Phone, and Virtually - Dave Harmeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;More an art than a science, the reference interview requires not only knowing a specific set of skills, but also how to apply those skills in an ever-changing world. Built around timeless service principles including Ranganathan&amp;rsquo;s Five Laws, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Reference Interview Today: Negotiating and Answering Questions Face to Face, on the Phone, and Virtually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a practical field guide to conducting reference interviews in every modality: face-to-face, phone, chat, text, virtual world such as Second Life, and even mashup reference interviews where multiple modalities are used to answer the question. Seamlessly combining both time-honored principles and multiple technologies, this practical book demonstrates how librarians can be as relevant and necessary in the digital age as in the print world. Appropriate for both novice and experienced librarians as well as for LIS students, this concise handbook speaks to those working in or preparing for careers in public, school, academic, and special libraries.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
