  <title>What Will Work: Fighting Climate Change with Renewable Energy, Not Nuclear Power - Kristin Shrader-Frechette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What Will Work makes a rigorous and compelling case that energy efficiencies and renewable energy-and not nuclear fission or clean coal-are the most effective, cheapest,  and equitable solutions to the pressing problem of climate change.    Kristin Shrader-Frechette, a respected environmental ethicist and scientist, makes a damning case that the only reason that debate about climate change continues is because fossil-fuel interests pay non-experts to confuse the public.  She then builds a comprehensive case against the argument made by many that nuclear fission is a viable solution to the problem, arguing that data on the viability of nuclear power has been misrepresented by the nuclear industry and its supporters.  In particular she says that they present deeply flawed cases that nuclear produces low greenhouse gas emissions, that it is financially responsible, that it is safe, and that its risks do not fall mainly on the poor and vulnerable.  She argues convincingly that these are all completely false assumptions.  Shrader-Frechette then shows that energy efficiency and renewable solutions meet all these requirements - in particular affordability, safety, and equitability.  In the end, the cheapest, lowest-carbon, most-sustainable energy solutions also happen to be the most ethical.   This urgent book on the most pressing issue of our time will be of interest to anyone involved in environmental and energy policy." />
