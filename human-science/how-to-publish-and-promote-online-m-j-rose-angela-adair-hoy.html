  <title>How to Publish and Promote Online - M. J. Rose, Angela Adair-Hoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everything you need to know about profitable online publishing and promotion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Stephen King to authors who haven&#39;t become household names quite yet, authors are increasingly turning to the Internet as a way of taking charge of their own publishing destiny. The opportunities are vast, but also confusing: Should you publish an e-book, a conventional print book, a Print On Demand book, a CD-ROM, or all of the above? What do you need to know to create an e-book? How do you set up a website, and how can you actually get people to visit that website? Where can you sell your books on the web? And how can you use the Internet to generate massive free publicity? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M. J. Rose and Angela Adair-Hoy provide the answers to all of these questions and more. When she self-published her first novel, Lip Service, as an e-book, M. J. Rose became a &quot;cyber pioneer&quot; (PW Daily) and attracted so much publicity that she sold the rights to a major book club and a New York publisher. As the co-owner of a highly successful e-book publisher, Booklocker, and the publisher of Writers Weekly, an e-magazine featuring markets for freelance writers, Angela Adair-Hoy also learned all of the possibilities that online publishing could offer. Using their own experiences-combined with insiders&#39; tips from other authors on the web-they published an e-book, The Secrets of Our Success, that became the underground bible for online authors and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now thoroughly revised and expanded, this book is an indispensable guide to navigating the publishing jungle from you own personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
