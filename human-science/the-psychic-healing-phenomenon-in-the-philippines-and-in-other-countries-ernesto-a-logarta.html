  <title>The Psychic Healing Phenomenon in the Philippines and in Other Countries - Ernesto A. Logarta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Filipino writers, in dealing with the psychic healing phenomenon in the Philippines, have utilized varied and diverse approaches to the practice of the native healers: naturalistic, psychological, medico, sociological, historical, anthropological, and occult. Foreign writers on the psychic healing phenomenon are more advanced in their approaches and techniques. Their emphasis is on paranormal reality, extra sensory perception (ESP), psychic diagnosis, altered states of conciousness, and salutary effects of love.
 Implied in the writings of some Filipino authors on psychic healing are the positive effects of the results of their researches on future education. Education can help the students make use of the herbal medicines in health preservation, disease prevention, and cure. Furthermore the impact of psychic healing in education can enhance positive states of the mind conducive to efficient learning.
 Lastly, the teacher who has access to the powers of the mind can be led to discover the salutary effects of love to maximize thinking abilities in so far as they relate to teaching and learning." />
