  <title>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Obsessive-compulsive Disorder - Victoria Bream, Fiona Challacombe, Asmita Palmer, Paul Salkovskis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Obsessive-compulsive disorder can be a very disabling and distressing problem. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be very effective in helping people to overcome OCD.  However, OCD is a highly heterogeneous disorder,  often complicated  by contextual  factors, and therapists are often left wondering how to  apply  their knowledge of treatment  to the particular problems as they face them in clinical  practice.
This book provides the reader with an understanding of the background  to and principles of using CBT for OCD in a clear practical &#39;how to&#39; style.  It also elucidates the particular challenges and solutions in applying CBT for OCD using illustrative case material  and  guidance on formulation-driven intervention. The book also addresses commonly occurring complexities in the treatment of OCD, for example working with comorbidity, perfectionism, shame and family involvement in symptoms.
Throughout the book, the authors provide tips on receiving and giving supervision to trouble-shoot commonly encountered problems, resulting in a guide that can help clinicians at all levels of experience." />
