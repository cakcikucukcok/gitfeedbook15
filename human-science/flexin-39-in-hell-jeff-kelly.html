  <title>Flexin&#39; in Hell - Jeff Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author, Jeff Kelly, a former healthcare executive, is a retired
Georgia Certified Teacher. (Social Sciences (6-12). He most
recently taught from 2007 through 2009, at the Paulding Regional
Youth Detention Center. (Dallas, GA) He states, I felt that I had
an important story to tell about a little- known, dark, under-side of
American Public Education as it is carried out daily in. Juvenile
Detention Centers all throughout America.
The Author further states: Because the subject matter can be
pretty grim and depressing, I felt that I needed to lighten things up
by finding and reporting The Funny as I occasionally found it in
such a dark place.
During the writing of this book a continuous stream of horrific news
stories emerged about the sorry state of Juvenile Justice in Georgia
and elsewhere in America. A few of those news stories have been
described herein." />
