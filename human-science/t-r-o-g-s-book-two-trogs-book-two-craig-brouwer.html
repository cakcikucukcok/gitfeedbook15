  <title>T.R.O.G.S. Book Two &lt;!--Trogs Book Two--&gt; - Craig Brouwer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A summary of the tales of T.R.O.G.S. and the psychiatric system: In T.R.O.G.S. Book One and Book Two you read some stories of the mentally ill and of the practice of the psychiatrist as well as the institutional descriptions. As you read, some parts of the stories of the psychiatric system may have been a bit dramatic, and some people will not agree with this, but it is as best a description of the world of the psychiatric system as I, the author, can give. But take it or leave it; its the truth and is not intended to disrupt any persons therapy or how they choose to lead their lives. But the people who read may have a better idea of what the author and some of the nine million schizophrenics in America have to deal with on a daily basis.  In most cases the relationship between the common person as well as mine is not the same, and the individuals who have had a bad time in their lives being used by the system will somehow relate to the scenario of conclusive descriptions that tell of the sorts of great measure that the system uses on each of the persons who have a psychiatric illness.  Also, this book may be a means to make life better for millions of people who suffer from abuse and open the doors to the law and amendments to give birth to new ideas and practices that a lot of people may benefit from.  I hope that you who have read will do your best to decide how you choose to live and that your lives will be happy. God bless.
This book has a realm of myth and folk lor that continue as well with religious phenomena and made up tales of crimes that were committed against humanity and people with mental handicaps.The oppressors of society using everyone in ways that do not benefit the people but make life miserable for all.Find some common answers and conclusions to the overly abusive oppressors. T.R.O.G.S. book two.Tales of trolls,sea monsters,crime,prejudice,religion,death,myth,sin,psychology,big foot,occult,and the paranormal" />
