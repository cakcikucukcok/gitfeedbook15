  <title>Exceptional Relationships - Brian Gleason, Marcia Gleason Lcsws</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The idea that partners in committed relationships elicit strong reactions in each other is self evident. That these passions are often overlooked in the therapy room is equally a reality. In this ground-breaking book, you will discover an innovative system for helping couples discover all of who they are. The Gleasons ask you to reconsider what it means to trust your intuition, make room for strong energies, work with the body, bring sexuality into the therapy room, and to elicit full emotional expression. Here you will learn to welcome the passionate, erotic, chaotic truths that are often kept under wraps in the therapy room.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exceptional Couples: Transformation Through Embodied Couples Work&lt;/i&gt; synthesizes modern developmental theories with the wisdom of somatic psychotherapy and reveals how embodying is fundamental to helping couples break their patterns of vitality destroying habits of interacting.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Gleasons invite you on a journey of the highest magnitude where couples can come fully alive. They generously open the door to their practice room, sharing in-depth case examples and effective strategies theyve developed over the course of their careers. They ask you to come along with them and live in the mystery of yet-to-be discovered places in every relationship.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Gleasons met in in 1976 in clinical social work graduate school. They have devoted their lives to exploring how couples, including themselves, can have exceptional (beyond the ordinary) relationships.&lt;/P&gt;
