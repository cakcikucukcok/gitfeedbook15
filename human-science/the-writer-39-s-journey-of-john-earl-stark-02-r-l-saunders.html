  <title>The Writer&#39;s Journey of John Earl Stark 02 - R. L. Saunders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;John Earl Stark problems were far from over. He was up to his neck and now his stories were running his life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All he wanted was to improve his book sales. But what he got was too many stories to write. And now he wasn&amp;#39;t sleeping as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
There were just too many and they wouldn&amp;#39;t stop coming. He simply couldn&amp;#39;t write them fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;
Worse, the stories were getting jumbled, the characters mixed.&lt;br /&gt;
If he didn&amp;#39;t do something soon, he&amp;#39;d probably go insane.&lt;br /&gt;
Focus. It&amp;#39;s a matter of focus.&lt;br /&gt;
And staying awake.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a week of too much and too little.&lt;br /&gt;
All delivered through dreams, or just after waking.&lt;br /&gt;
John got way too many. He&amp;#39;d find himself awake with a story sitting there, but it would be 2 or 3 am. So he&amp;#39;d turn over, and then at 4am he&amp;#39;d be woken with another.&lt;br /&gt;
You know the one&amp;#39;s he writes - mysterious supernatural situations only a human can save them from. So he was right in to these opening scenes, like a moving running along through his mind. Dumped right in the middle of the action and all the charactes shouting out their lines in &amp;ldquo;3D Cinerama-scope&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
But the other stories that woke him up that early morning seemed gone.&lt;br /&gt;
If he just lay there and close his eyes, they&amp;#39;d be back, though - either starting over or picking up where they left off.&lt;br /&gt;
Rolling over tended to help.&lt;br /&gt;
By the time it was light enough to see, he was still exhausted and now had all the chores of the farm to take care of. Dogs and cats to feed, a milkcow to relieve, cattle to check. Those things aren&amp;#39;t just put off. Real live creatures needing his care.&lt;br /&gt;
So he&amp;#39;d be up and at them, somehow keeping his eyes open enough to not burn himself during breakfast. Slogging through the weather and the routines. Then he&amp;#39;d come back and shrug out of his outdoor clothes and collapse on his couch for &amp;quot;just a few minutes&amp;quot; - only to find himself with yet another story waking him and demanding to be written into existence.&lt;br /&gt;
After a few days of this, he finally would get a pad and paper by his bed, and turn on the light to write down the opening scene and any details - something he could use later to hopefully pick up that story again.&lt;br /&gt;
Didn&amp;#39;t work out. He did have 6 or 8 new opening scenes he could mine. But where they went from there was still another problem.&lt;br /&gt;
At last, he did just force himself to sit down and write one of them all the way out. But it was a mystery from the start. He only had a scrap of a line to write from. But write he did - and it turned out OK. 6K words where this team of his spooks go and take on the entire government to get them to stop hunting people with &amp;quot;extraordinary abilities&amp;quot; just so they could do their genetic research and experiments. Happy ending, an all that.&lt;br /&gt;
For me, it was worse.&lt;br /&gt;
I took his idea of getting that pad and paper, but I only wound up with lists of phrases. And spent most of the night tossing and turning to get back to sleep again.&lt;br /&gt;
Then daylight would make sleep impossible - and I&amp;#39;d trudge over to John&amp;#39;s cabin for some of his to-die-for coffee with honey.&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t share his love of watching cattle graze, so pretty much I&amp;#39;d sit out on the front porch with his farm dog and pet her if she wanted it. Otherwise, just relax. Maybe with one of those books. Sometimes dozing off again.&lt;br /&gt;
When John came back, we&amp;#39;d hit the books again.&lt;br /&gt;
