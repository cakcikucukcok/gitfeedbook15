  <title>Harmony and Matter - Federico Reyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heaven is here, with us, all the time and we can access it at any moment. The only problem is that we are not aware of that possibility.
Everybody would like to get in Paradise and spend the rest of the existence over there but, we dont have to go anywhere because Paradise is right here and we can start entering here and right now. We dont have to pass any test or evaluation process, but we do have to work hard to overcome the main obstacle in our way: matter.
The problems of being and the existence, in general, are usually very complicated issues to handle, but they are so mainly because of those, trying to rule over the search of the truth, with no real understanding of it and, even more, with very fundamental problems to communicate anything, have and are distorting and complicating things around, to the point we have to become professional philosophers, for instance, to try to understand the complications of philosophers that they, themselves, arent able to understand. Not to talk about politics and religion.
But, the truth is much simpler than that, and everyone can access his own truth, with the only inconvenience that it touches his relationship with his material life.
Harmony and Matter is a new perspective that might help see a little clearer the panorama of life all human beings are confronted with and all the ocean of confusion and chaos of ideas, mostly interested in preserving a material status of a very little spiritual existence that, in any case, is also very little important in the context of Universal life.
Everyone would like to know, also, some tips to live the best possible life and, Harmony, as the essence of the Universe, is the only answer we can find. Here youll find the reasons why.
Life is, certainly, not easy but is perfectly possible to find a recipe for a happy, healthier and creative life. There have been many attempts, in the past, to get to a comprehensive formula for happiness, from very different perspectives, and we can use as many as we want because most of them could be very useful. Harmony and Matter is just another one, from a very contemporary perspective, trying to dissect the relationship between matter and spirit, so basic in our daily life, in the most simple and clear possible way.
Reality is present with us, all the time, and we have no choice than trying to understand it the best we can, in order to live a better life.
