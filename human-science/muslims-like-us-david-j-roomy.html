  <title>Muslims Like Us - David J. Roomy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever wonder if there are alternatives to hostilities between nations and cultural groups? Would you be interested in learning more about common roots and values among Muslims and Westerners? More so, would you like to learn ways the individual citizen can work for increasing understanding between Westerners and Muslims? If so, &lt;I&gt;Muslims Like Us&lt;/I&gt;, provides some answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The author, David Roomy, learned about cross-cultural communication during the height of the Cold War. Living in New York City during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he grasped the urgency of finding forms of communication between hostile groups. He then helped form a program involving articulate graduate students, from counties along the Iron Curtain, with powerful U.S. corporate executives. After the destruction of war, we often ask ourselves, &quot;Couldn&#39;t something more have been done beforehand?&quot; &lt;I&gt;Muslims Like Us&lt;/I&gt; speaks directly to that creative approach toward finding bridges of communication, now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Roomy speaks here about his mentor in this field, William Harrison Kennedy, who made a difference in world tensions. Roomy speaks about alternatives to warring and also opens up Muslim secular literature and the Grail legend in the West to discover common roots of Muslim and Western peoples.&lt;/p&gt;" />
