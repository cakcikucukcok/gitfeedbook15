  <title>&quot;Man and World System&quot; by E.Kuzmin and V.Berezovsky - Evgraph Sevastianovich Kuzmin, Victor Iliych Berezovskiy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While Philo of Alexandria transformed Ontos into God, our task is dialectical transformation of God into Ontos. While implementing the reverse transition from God to Ontos, we need to move from the metaphysical and idealistic monism to the dialectical materialist one, from the horizontal historical outlook to the vertical ontological one, from the religious and mystical perception of the World to the rational and realistic one. Ontological focusing of the World implies a materialistic shift of the original starting point. Technologically and economically, the globally united world is to be placed on the ontologically unified ideological foundation. Not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ontology is the science of Ontos, the way out of the deadlock and the basis of Salvation. Immanuel Kant said that there is nothing more desirable for a philosopher than finding a single principle that would make it possible to understand and explain everything that exists and happens in the world. The concept of self-movement and self-development of Ontos is Kant&amp;rsquo;s sought-for principle of science, its genetic and logical code.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept of self-movement and self-development of Ontos through the interaction of the antipodes comprises the subject, the &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;, and the method, &amp;lsquo;dialectics&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;the interaction of the antipodes&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;Self-movement&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;self-development&amp;rsquo; point to the absence of any external and otherworldly, creational and demiurgic, mythical and theological forces that gave rise to Ontos.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept of self-movement and self-development of Ontos through the interaction of the antipodes is absolutely complete, absolutely self-sufficient, and absolutely closed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is the very End and the very Beginning, Alpha and Omega, the Aeon of Aeons, the Holy of Holies, and the Science of sciences. The science of Ontos, ontology, is the &amp;lsquo;Big science&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aristotle called the science of Ontos &amp;lsquo;The first philosophy&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kant considered ontology the culmination of the human mind&amp;rsquo;s culture. The concept of self-movement and self-development of Ontos is the key to the logical mystery of the human brain, the secret of thought laboratory. Ontology is the basis of the knowledge and understanding of the world. It is also the basis of the human creative activities. Ontology is a concrete, practical science. Ontos as the highest level of everything in existence contains the entire world in all its diversity. It points to the genetic unity of the material and ideal, natural and social, objective and subjective, manmade and non-manmade. Ontos makes the infinite things finite, the eternal things transient. It turns the relative into the absolute, the unobservable into the observable. It makes the diverse things single. It turns the common into the single, the abstract into the concrete, the implicit into the explicit, and the intuitive into the conscious. It makes the remote close, and it turns the historical into the logical.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ontos turns the genetic code of the development of the matter into the logical code of understanding the world. Ontology as the &amp;lsquo;Logical philosophy&amp;rsquo; is not supposed to go through the absurdities of modern bourgeois speculative philosophy. The existing should make the foundation of the education system.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without logical understanding and consistent explanation and development of the structure of Ontos, the latter would make no sense and become vacuous and empty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
