  <title>Scales of Justice: Reimagining Political Space in a Globalizing World - Nancy Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;Until recently, struggles for justice proceeded against the background of a taken-for-granted frame: the bounded territorial state. With that &quot;Westphalian&quot; picture of political space assumed by default, the scope of justice was rarely subject to open dispute. Today, however, human-rights activists and international feminists join critics of structural adjustment and the World Trade Organization in challenging the view that justice can only be a domestic relation among fellow citizens. Targeting injustices that cut across borders, they are making the scale of justice an object of explicit struggle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Inspired by these efforts, Nancy Fraser asks: What is the proper frame for theorizing justice? Faced with a plurality of competing scales, how do we know which one is truly just? In exploring these questions, Fraser revises her widely discussed theory of redistribution and recognition. She introduces a third, &quot;political&quot; dimension of justice&amp;#38; mdash;representation&amp;#38; mdash;and elaborates a new, reflexive type of critical theory that foregrounds injustices of &quot;misframing.&quot; Engaging with thinkers such as J&amp;#252;rgen Habermas, John Rawls, Michel Foucault, and Hannah Arendt, she envisions a &quot;postwestphalian&quot; mapping of political space that accommodates transnational solidarity, transborder publicity, and democratic frame-setting, as well as emancipatory projects that cross borders. The result is a sustained reflection on who should count with respect to what in a globalizing world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
