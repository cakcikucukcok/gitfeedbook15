  <title>The Art of Waiting - Belle Boggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A brilliant exploration of the natural, medical, psychological, and political facets of fertility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Belle Boggs&#39;s &quot;The Art of Waiting&quot; was published in &lt;i&gt;Orion&lt;/i&gt; in 2012, it went viral, leading to republication in &lt;i&gt;Harper&#39;s Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, an interview on NPR&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Diane Rehm Show&lt;/i&gt;, and a spot at the intersection of &quot;highbrow&quot; and &quot;brilliant&quot; in &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; magazine&#39;s &quot;Approval Matrix.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In  that heartbreaking essay, Boggs eloquently recounts her realization  that she might never be able to conceive. She searches the apparently  fertile world around her--the emergence of thirteen-year cicadas, the  birth of eaglets near her rural home, and an unusual gorilla pregnancy  at a local zoo--for signs that she is not alone. Boggs also explores  other aspects of fertility and infertility: the way longing for a child  plays out in the classic Coen brothers film &lt;i&gt;Raising Arizona&lt;/i&gt;; the depiction of childlessness in literature, from &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Who&#39;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&lt;/i&gt;;  the financial and legal complications that accompany alternative means  of family making; the private and public expressions of iconic writers  grappling with motherhood and fertility. She reports, with great  empathy, complex stories of couples who adopted domestically and from  overseas, LGBT couples considering assisted reproduction and surrogacy,  and women and men reflecting on childless or child-free lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Art of Waiting&lt;/i&gt;, Boggs  deftly distills her time of waiting into an expansive contemplation of  fertility, choice, and the many possible roads to making a life and  making a family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
