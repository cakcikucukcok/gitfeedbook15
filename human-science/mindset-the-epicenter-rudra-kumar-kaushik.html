  <title>Mindset—The Epicenter - Rudra Kumar Kaushik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mindsetthe Epicenter is a one volume work, which probes as to why two persons having the same mind (physical composition of brain) made of the same electrons, protons, and neutrons generally behave differently with their fellow beings in their day-to-day lives, even in the similar circumstances.
The author wants to solve this age-old dilemma. Sri Ram and Rawana, Balmiki and Ratnakar, Sri,  Krishna and Duryodhana, Buddha, Vivekanand, and Osama Bin Laden had been gifted the same mind made of the same atoms by the nature. Then how did they possess virtuous and vicious mind-sets respectively? Who is and what is actually responsible for this variance in human behavior and human varieties in this world? Has the so-called divine intelligence really been playing the role of a puppeteer? Would we justify to those epoch-making human giants if we dub them puppets? Tsunami waves of troubles in mans life have been flowing quite high in the whole human ocean. The author wants to solve this age-old puzzle. Then who is actually the troublemaker as well as the troubleshooter in human lives?
Naturally, the author holds that our minds are in an unprecedented grip of fear, tension, uncertainty, and suspicion due to some troubles. Hence, he is of this opinion that people in general are losing charm in their lives.
Thats why the author feels that it seems as if we are on an undeclared war with one another for long in Hobbesian language." />
