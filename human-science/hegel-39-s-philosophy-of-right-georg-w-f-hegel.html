  <title>Hegel&#39;s Philosophy of Right - Georg W. F. Hegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was one of the foremost philosophers of the nineteenth century, best known for his exploration of the realm of human existence, and, in particular, his beliefs in an ultimate reality called the Absolute Spirit. A lifelong scholar, theorist, lecturer and writer, Hegel&#39;s reputation as the most important philosopher in Germany eventually led to his prestigious post as Chair of Philosophy at the University of Berlin in 1818, a position he would hold till his death in 1831. In 1820, Hegel published his most sophisticated statements of legal, moral, social and political philosophy in his &quot;Philosophy of Right.&quot; The work begins with a discussion of the concept of free will, and progresses into the examination of Hegel&#39;s three spheres of &#39;right&#39;: abstract right, morality, and ethical life. Although Hegel&#39;s reputation has diminished significantly, his influence can be seen in the works of such important figures as Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, F. W. Bradley, and John Dewey." />

    	<p>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was one of the foremost philosophers of the nineteenth century, best known for his exploration of the realm of human existence, and, in particular, his beliefs in an ultimate reality called the Absolute Spirit. A lifelong scholar, theorist, lecturer and writer, Hegel's reputation as the most important philosopher in Germany eventually led to his prestigious post as Chair of Philosophy at the University of Berlin in 1818, a position he would hold till his death in 1831. In 1820, Hegel published his most sophisticated statements of legal, moral, social and political philosophy in his "Philosophy of Right." The work begins with a discussion of the concept of free will, and progresses into the examination of Hegel's three spheres of 'right': abstract right, morality, and ethical life. Although Hegel's reputation has diminished significantly, his influence can be seen in the works of such important figures as Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, F. W. Bradley, and John Dewey.</p>
