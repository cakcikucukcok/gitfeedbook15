  <title>Familiar Faces, Less Familiar Stories - Debaprasad Mukherjee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am a thief. While travelling through a rather longish journey of life, I was fortunate enough to come across a variety of characters. There were moments with them that were worth stealing. I have stolen them and preserved carefully in a sacred corner of my heart. Now the time has come when it looks selfish that I have failed to share my treasure with the masses in general and the connoisseurs in particular. While going through the book, you are sure to come across the characters that you encounter in day-to-day life. All of them have a story. Some of these strike a chord in you. These are the things you preserve and that is reflected in you as well. Feelings are precious and make a permanent impression which you carry forward. This is the essence of literature.
While I said this, there is no claim from my side that the works are of great literary value. It is my humble endeavour to share my stolen treasure with you so that I am no more tagged as selfish. There are eleven short stories in this collection. The characters belong to different walks of life, and are mostly commoners; like you and me. But do the commoners not have uncommon stories? My success depends on whether you enjoy the stories. It is after all, the enjoyment that matters." />
