  <title>Write Your Book! Publish Your Book! Market Your Book! - Blythe Ayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writers are no longer constrained&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;by a narrow, subjective, bottleneck in the river of publication, commandeered by a handful of people determining if our work will ever see the light of day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As indie authors, our readers support our writing&amp;mdash;and not only by buying it, but by writing us and letting us know what they love in our stories, or what has helped them in our nonfiction books.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As an indie author you&amp;rsquo;re in the awesome and delightful position of interacting directly with your readers. You get to discover for yourself what strikes a resonating chord with them, instead of hoping a publisher and its team will find your readership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indie authors have the privilege of interacting personally, one-on-one, with the people who have discovered our writing, who are delighted to be able to communicate with the author of the stories and the information that has touched their lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We live in astounding times!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;are responsible to produce your book. No one is going to do it but you. You have to provide your own deadlines, and you must meet them. No one&amp;mdash;but you&amp;mdash;will demand that you turn in your manuscript.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help you along, in&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write Your Book! Publish Your Book! Market Your Book!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;you&amp;rsquo;ll find&amp;nbsp; a plethora of relevant, cutting-edge help in these three major fields&amp;mdash;writing, publishing, marketing&amp;mdash;where you must learn the ropes in order to have your unique, only-you-can-write-it book in the hands of the people who are, even now, looking for it (not yet realizing it), when they scan the millions of published books.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ever-growing and successful Indie Movement has shown that we writers do, indeed, know what people want to read. We&amp;rsquo;re proving we are capable of producing intriguing and significant writing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are a start-up &amp;hellip;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The next great business is you.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
