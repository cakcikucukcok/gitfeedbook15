  <title>Insider Outsider - Bryan Loritts, John Ortberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God boldly proclaims throughout the book of Acts, &quot;There is no ethnic home team when it comes to Christianity.&quot; But the minority experience in America today--and throughout history--too often tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pastor Bryan Loritts wrote an op-ed piece in &lt;em&gt;Christianity Today &lt;/em&gt;about this &quot;evangelical gentrification&quot; in the American church, he received an overwhelming response of more than one million views and sparked a provocative national conversation. In &lt;em&gt;Insider Outsider, &lt;/em&gt;Loritts dives deeper into what it&#39;s like to be a person of color in predominantly white evangelical spaces today and where we go from here. Drawing on insightful snapshots through history, eye-opening personal experiences, and biblical exposition, Loritts awakens both our minds and hearts to the painful reality of racial divides as well as the hope of forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Loritts writes, &quot;It is impossible to do theology devoid of cultural lenses and expressions. Like an American unaware of their own accent, most whites are unaware of the ethnic theological accent they carry.&quot; &lt;em&gt;Insider Outsider &lt;/em&gt;bears witness to the true stories that often go untold--stories that will startle, enlighten, and herald a brighter way forward for all seeking belonging in the family of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seminal book on race and the church will help Christians discover how they can learn the art of listening to stories unlike their own, identify the problems and pitfalls that keep Sunday morning the most segregated hour of the week, and participate in an active movement with God toward a holy vision of what Dietrich Bonhoeffer calls &quot;life together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
