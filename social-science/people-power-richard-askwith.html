  <title>People Power - Richard Askwith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;British parliamentary democracy is in a state of advanced decay. The symptoms are familiar: party machines with no goal beyond their own survival; donors and lobbyists whose interests trump the nation’s; a disillusioned electorate; and an over-mighty executive whose patronage has become the main driving force of politics. These rots have mixed to breed a caste of career politician more concerned with serving patrons than constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve known this for years, but what can we do about it beyond not bothering to vote? However, in the past decade, a new generation’s digital revolution has gradually given a voice to the hitherto unheard masses.  Its contribution to political discourse, once limited to the occasional ‘X’ on a ballot paper, has been rude, vigorous, anarchic – and spectacularly influential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tide has turned. The result? A slump in support for the big parties, the rejection of mainstream candidates in the Labour leadership contest; the roar of pent-up rage against the Brussels-friendly elite that led to the Brexit vote of June 2016; and then, five months later, the seemingly crazed elevation of Donald Trump to become the most powerful man in the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
