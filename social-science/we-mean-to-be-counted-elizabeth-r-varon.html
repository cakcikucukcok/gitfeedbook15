  <title>We Mean to Be Counted - Elizabeth R. Varon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past two decades, historians have successfully disputed&lt;br/&gt;the notion that American women remained wholly outside the realm of politics until the early twentieth century. Still, a consensus has prevailed that, unlike their Northern counterparts, women of the antebellum South were largely excluded from public life. With this book, Elizabeth Varon effectively challenges such historical assumptions. Using a wide array of sources, she demonstrates that throughout the antebellum period, white Southern women of the slaveholding class were important actors in the public drama of politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Through their voluntary associations, legislative petitions,&lt;br/&gt;presence at political meetings and rallies, and published&lt;br/&gt;appeals, Virginia&#39;s elite white women lent their support to such&lt;br/&gt;controversial reform enterprises as the temperance movement and the American Colonization Society, to the electoral campaigns of the Whig and Democratic Parties, to the literary defense of&lt;br/&gt;slavery, and to the causes of Unionism and secession. Against the backdrop of increasing sectional tension, Varon argues, these&lt;br/&gt;women struggled to fulfill a paradoxical mandate: to act both as&lt;br/&gt;partisans who boldly expressed their political views and as&lt;br/&gt;mediators who infused public life with the &quot;feminine&quot; virtues of&lt;br/&gt;compassion and harmony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
