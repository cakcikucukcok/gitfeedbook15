  <title>Black Death: AIDS in Africa - Susan Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To the surprise of many, George W. Bush pledged $10 billion to combat AIDS in developing nations.  Noted specialist Susan Hunter tells the untold story of AIDS in Africa, home to 80 percent of the 40 million people in the world currently infected with HIV. She weaves together the history of colonialism in Africa, an insider&#39;s take on the reluctance of drug companies to provide cheap medication and vaccines in poor countries, and personal anecdotes from the 20 years she spent in Africa working on the AIDS crisis.  Taken together, these strands make it unmistakably clear that a history of the exploitation of developing nations by the West is directly responsible for the spread of disease in developing nations and the AIDS pandemic in Africa.  Hunter looks at what Africans are already doing on the ground level to combat AIDS, and what the world can and must do to help.  Accessibly written and hard-hitting,&lt;i&gt;Black Death&lt;/i&gt; brings the staggering statistics to life and paints for the first time a stunning picture of the most important political issue today." />
