  <title>Gender and the Mexican Revolution - Stephanie J. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The state of Yucatan is commonly considered to have been a hotbed of radical feminism during the Mexican Revolution. Challenging this romanticized view, Stephanie Smith examines the revolutionary reforms designed to break women&#39;s ties to tradition and religion, as well as the ways in which women shaped these developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smith analyzes the various regulations introduced by Yucatan&#39;s two revolution-era governors, Salvador Alvarado and Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Like many revolutionary leaders throughout Mexico, the Yucatan policy makers professed allegiance to women&#39;s rights and socialist principles. Yet they, too, passed laws and condoned legal practices that excluded women from equal participation and reinforced their inferior status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using court cases brought by ordinary women, including those of Mayan descent, Smith demonstrates the importance of women&#39;s agency during the Mexican Revolution. But, she says, despite the intervention of women at many levels of Yucatecan society, the rigid definition of women&#39;s social roles as strictly that of wives and mothers within the Mexican nation guaranteed that long-term, substantial gains remained out of reach for most women for years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
