  <title>If the War Goes On . . . - Hermann Hesse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the most astonishing aspects of Hesse&#39;s career is the clear-sightedness and consistency of his political views, his passionate espousal of pacifism and internationalism from the start of World War I to the end of his life. The earliest essay in this book was written in September 1914 and was followed by a stream of letters, essays, and pamphlets that reached its high point with &lt;i&gt;Zarathustra&#39;s Return&lt;/i&gt; (published anonymously in 1919, the year that also saw the publication of &lt;i&gt;Demian&lt;/i&gt;), in which Hesse exhorted German youth to shake off the false gods of nationalism and militarism that had led their country into the abyss. Such views earned him the labels &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;viper&quot; in Germany, but after World War II he was moved to reiterate his beliefs in another series of essays and letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hesse arranged his anti-war writing for publication in one volume in 1946; an amplified edition appeared in 1949 and that text has been followed for this first English-language edition. In his foreword Hesse describes the heart of the philosophy expressed here: &quot;In each one of these essays I strive to guide the reader not into the world theater with its political problemns but into his innermost being, before the judgment seat of his very personal conscience.&quot; This faith in salvation via the Inward Way, so familiar to readers of Hesse&#39;s fiction, is persuasively set forth as the answer to questions of war and peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
