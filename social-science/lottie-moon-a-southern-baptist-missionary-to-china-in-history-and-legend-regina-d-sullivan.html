  <title>Lottie Moon: A Southern Baptist Missionary to China in History and Legend - Regina D. Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Legendary Southern Baptist missionary Charlotte &quot;Lottie&quot; Moon played a pivotal role in revolutionizing southern civil society. Her involvement in the establishment of the Women&#39;s Missionary Union provided white Baptist women with an alternate means of gaining and asserting power within the denomination&#39;s organizational structure and changed it forever. In Lottie Moon: A Southern Baptist Missionary to China in History and Legend Regina Sullivan provides the first comprehensive portrait of &quot;Lottie,&quot; who not only empowered women but also inspired the formation of one of the most influential religious organizations in the United States.&lt;br&gt;Despite being the daughter of slaveholders in antebellum Virginia, Moon never lived the life of a typical southern belle. Highly educated and influenced by models of independent womanhood, including an older sister who was a woman&#39;s rights advocate, an open opponent of slavery, and the first Virginian female to earn a medical degree, Moon followed her sister&#39;s lead and utilized her extensive education to successfully combine the language of woman&#39;s rights with the egalitarian impulse of evangelical Protestantism.&lt;br&gt;In 1873 Moon found her true calling, however, in missionary work in China. During her tenure there she recommended that the week before Christmas be designated as a time of giving to foreign missions. In response to her vision, thousands of Southern Baptist women organized local missionary societies to collect funds, and in 1888, the Woman&#39;s Missionary Union was founded as the Southern Baptist Convention&#39;s female auxiliary for missionary work.&lt;br&gt;Sullivan credits Moon&#39;s role in the establishment of the Woman&#39;s Missionary Union as having a significant impact on the erosion of patriarchal power and women&#39;s new engagement with the public sphere. Since her initial plea in 1888, the Missionary Union&#39;s annual &quot;Lottie Moon Christmas Offering&quot; has raised over a billion dollars to support missionary work.&lt;br&gt;Lottie Moon captures the influence and culminating effect of one woman&#39;s personal, spiritual, and civic calling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
