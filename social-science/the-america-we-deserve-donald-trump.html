  <title>The America We Deserve - Donald Trump</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The essential, bestselling book that first defined President Donald Trump&#39;s political ideas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The America We Deserve&lt;/i&gt; is the essential book for anyone who wants to understand the core of Donald Trump&#39;s political thinking. In this book, written as he first considered running for president in 2000, Trump offers no-nonsense, populist, provocative, and dramatic solutions to issues that continue to resonate with voters today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, Trump lays out a vision for America that is strong, optimistic, and founded on core Republican principles of self-reliance, limited governance, economic growth, and equitable taxation. Striking for its similarities to President Trump&#39;s current initiatives--but also fascinating in its differences--&lt;i&gt;The America We Deserve &lt;/i&gt;reveals a man who is fully engaged with the nation and cares deeply about its future. Readers and voters will discover Trump&#39;s ideas on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Foreign policy and relations with China, Russia, North Korea, and Israel&lt;br&gt;*How to fix our broken and underperfoming education system&lt;br&gt;*Reducing regulations on business to help create jobs and economic growth&lt;br&gt;*A dramatic one-time tax on the super-wealthy to close the national debt and fuel tax cuts for the middle class&lt;br&gt;*Immigration, crime, terrorism, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The America We Deserve&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading for Trump-watchers, voters, Republicans, Democrats, and anyone interested in how Trump the businessman became Trump the president.&lt;/p&gt;" />
