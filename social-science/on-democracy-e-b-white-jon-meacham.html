  <title>On Democracy - E. B. White, Jon Meacham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt; New &amp;#38; Noteworthy Title&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A collection of essays, letters and poems from E.B. White, &amp;#8220;one of the country&amp;#8217;s great literary treasures&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;New York Times)&lt;/em&gt;, centered on the subject of freedom and democracy in America.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I am a member of a party of one, and I live in an age of fear.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These words were written by E. B. White in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades before our current political turmoil, White crafted eloquent yet practical political statements that continue to resonate. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s only one kind of press that&amp;#8217;s any good&amp;#8212;&amp;#8221; he proclaimed, &amp;#8220;a press free from any taint of the government.&amp;#8221; He condemned the trend of defamation, arguing that &amp;#8220;in doubtful, doubting days, national morality tends to slip and slide toward a condition in which the test of a man&amp;#8217;s honor is his zeal for discovering dishonor in others.&amp;#8221; And on the spread of fascism he lamented, &amp;#8220;fascism enjoys at the moment an almost perfect climate for growth&amp;#8212;a world of fear and hunger.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anchored by an introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham, this concise collection of essays, letters, and poems from one of this country&amp;#8217;s most eminent literary voices offers much-needed historical context for our current state of the nation&amp;#8212;and hope for the future of our society. Speaking to Americans at a time of uncertainty, when democracy itself has come under threat, he reminds us, &amp;#8220;As long as there is one upright man, as long as there is one compassionate woman . . . the scene is not desolate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;" />
