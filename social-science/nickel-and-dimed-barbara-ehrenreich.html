  <title>Nickel and Dimed - Barbara Ehrenreich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barbara Ehrenreich, our sharpest and most original social critic, goes &quot;undercover&quot; in &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dmined&lt;/i&gt; as an unskilled worker to reveal the dark side of American prosperity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans work full time, year round, for poverty-level wages. In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a job -- any job -- can be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was offered. Moving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, she worked as a waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing-home aide, and a Wal-Mart sales clerk. She lived in trailer parks and crumbling residential motels. Very quickly, she discovered that no job is truly &quot;unskilled,&quot; that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort. She also learned that one job is not enough; you need at least two if you int to live indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity -- a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival. Read it for the smoldering clarity of Ehrenreich&#39;s perspective and for a rare view of how &quot;prosperity&quot; looks from the bottom. You will never see anything -- from a motel bathroom to a restaurant meal -- in quite the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
