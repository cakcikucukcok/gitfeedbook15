  <title>Humanitarianism and Mass Migration - Marcelo M. Suárez-Orozco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world is witnessing a rapid rise in the numbers of migrants&amp;mdash;voluntary and involuntary, internal and international, authorized and unauthorized&amp;mdash;as well as victims of human trafficking. In just the first quarter of this century alone, more than 65 million people have been forced to escape home into the unknown. The slow-motion disintegration of failing states with feeble institutions, war and terror, demographic imbalances, unchecked climate change, and cataclysmic environmental disruptions have contributed to these catastrophic migrations that are placing millions of human beings at grave risk.&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Humanitarianism and Mass Migration&amp;#160;&lt;/I&gt;is the first book of its kind that fills the scholarly gap of examining the current uncharted contours of mass migration. Exceptionally curated with contributions from Jacqueline Bhabha, Richard Mollica,&amp;#160;Irina Bokova,&amp;#160;Pedro Noguera,&amp;#160;Hirokazu Yoshikawa,&amp;#160;James A. Banks, Mary Waters, and many others, the volume&amp;rsquo;s interdisciplinary and comparative lens showcases new research that reveals how current structures of health, mental health, and education are anachronistic and out of touch with the entirely new cartographies of mass migrations. And with an eye towards a hopeful and realistic future, the volume provides clear and concrete recommendations of the work we must do to mine the inherent agency, cultural resources, resilience, and capacity for self-healing to help forcefully displaced populations.&lt;BR /&gt;" />
