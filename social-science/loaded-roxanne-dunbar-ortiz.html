  <title>Loaded - Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;America loves guns. From Daniel Boone and Jesse James to the NRA and Seal Team 6, gun culture has colored the lore, shaped the law, and protected the market that arms the nation. In &lt;em&gt;Loaded&lt;/em&gt;, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz peels away the myths of gun culture to expose the true historical origins of the Second Amendment, exposing the racial undercurrents connecting the earliest Anglo settlers with contemporary gun proliferation, modern-day policing, and the consolidation of influence of armed white nationalists. From the enslavement of Blacks and the conquest of Native America, to the arsenal of institutions that constitute the &quot;gun lobby,&quot; &lt;em&gt;Loaded&lt;/em&gt; presents a people&#39;s history of the Second Amendment, as seen through the lens of those who have been most targeted by guns: people of color. Meticulously researched and thought-provoking throughout, this is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the historical connections between racism and gun violence in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz&lt;/strong&gt; grew up in rural Oklahoma, the daughter of a tenant farmer and part-Indian mother. She is the author of many books, including &lt;em&gt;Outlaw Woman&lt;/em&gt;, a memoir of the 1960s and her time in an armed underground group, and the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;An Indigenous Peoples&#39; History of the United States&lt;/em&gt;. She lives in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt; recognizes the central truth about our &#39;gun culture&#39;: that the privileged place of guns in American law and society is the by-product of the racial and class violence that has marked our history from its beginnings.&quot;--Richard Slotkin, author of &lt;i&gt;The Gunfighter Nation: Myth of the Frontier in Twentieth-Century America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trigger warning! This is a superb and subtle book, not an intellectual safe space for confirming your preconceptions--whatever those might be--but rather a deeply necessary provocation. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz has done it again, giving us a fluid and sweeping history of the many painful contradictions that are the deep history of America&#39;s love–hate relationship with firearms. In understanding that history, &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt; also unpacks the contemporary pathologies of both fanatical gun culture and quixotic liberal moralizing against guns. As Dunbar-Ortiz shows us, the key connection between these antagonistic positions is their shared silence on that most pressing and persistent of American problems: economic exploitation and inequality.&quot;--Christian Parenti, author of &lt;i&gt;Lockdown America: Police and Prisons in the Age of Crisis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;From an eminent scholar comes this timely and urgent intervention on U.S. gun culture. &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt; is a high-impact assault on the idea that Second Amendment rights were ever intended for all Americans. A timely antidote to our national amnesia about the white supremacist and settler colonialist roots of the Second Amendment.&quot;--Caroline Light, author of &lt;i&gt;Stand Your Ground: A History of America&#39;s Love Affair with Lethal Self-Defense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With her usual unassailable rigor for detail and deep perspective, Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz has potentially changed the debate about gun control in the United States. She meticulously and convincingly argues that U.S. gun culture--and the domestic and global massacres that have flowed from it--must be linked to an understanding of the ideological, historical, and practical role of guns in seizing Native American lands, black enslavement, and global imperialism. This is an essential work for policy-makers, street activists, and educators who are concerned with Second Amendment debates, #blacklivematters campaigns, global peace, and community-based security.&quot;&amp;mdash;Clarence Lusane, Chairman and Professor of Political Science at Howard University and author of &lt;i&gt;The Black History of the White House&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just what did the founding fathers intend the Second Amendment to do? Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz&#39;s answer to that question will unsettle liberal gun control advocates and open-carry aficionados alike. She follows the bloodstains of today&#39;s mass shootings back to the slave patrols and Indian Wars. There are no easy answers here, just the tough reckoning with history needed to navigate ourselves away from a future filled with more tragedies.&quot;&amp;mdash;James Tracy, co-author of &lt;i&gt;Hillbilly Nationalists, Urban Race Rebels and Black Power: Community Organizing in Radical Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gun violence, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz compellingly shows, is as U.S. American as apple pie. This important book peels back the painful and bloody layers of gun culture in the United States, and exposes their deep roots in the killing and dispossession of Native peoples, slavery and its aftermath, and U.S. empire-making. They are roots with which all who are concerned with matters of justice, basic decency, and the enduring tragedy of the U.S. love affair with guns must grapple.&quot;--Joseph Nevins, author of &lt;i&gt;Dying to Live: A Story of U.S. Immigration in an Age of Global Apartheid&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt; is a masterful synthesis of the historical origins of violence and militarism in the US. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz reminds us of what we&#39;ve chosen to forget at our own peril: that from mass shootings to the routine deployment of violence against civilians by the US military, American violence flows from the normalization of racialized violence in our country’s founding history.&quot;--Johanna Fernandez, Assistant Professor of History at Baruch College of the City University, and author of the forthcoming book, &lt;i&gt;When the World Was Their Stage: A History of the Young Lords Party, 1968–1976&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Roxanne Dunbar-Oritz&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt; argues U.S. history is quintessential gun history, and gun history is a history of racial terror and genocide. In other words, gun culture has never been about hunting. From crushing slave rebellions to Indigenous resistance, arming individual white settler men has always been the strategy for maintaining racial and class rule and for taking Indigenous land from the founding of the settler nation to the present. With clarity and urgency, Dunbar-Ortiz asks us not to think of our current moment as an exceptional era of mass-shootings. Instead, the very essence of the Second Amendment and the very project of U.S. &#39;settler democracy&#39; has required immense violence that began with Indigenous genocide and has expanded to endless war-making across the globe. This is a must read for any student of U.S. history.&quot; --Nick Estes is the author of the forthcoming book &lt;i&gt;Our History is the Future: Mni Wiconi and Native Liberation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
