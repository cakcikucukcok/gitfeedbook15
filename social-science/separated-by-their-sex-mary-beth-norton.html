  <title>Separated by Their Sex - Mary Beth Norton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Separated by Their Sex&lt;/em&gt;, Mary Beth Norton offers a bold genealogy that shows how gender came to determine the right of access to the Anglo-American public sphere by the middle of the eighteenth century. Earlier, high-status men and women alike had been recognized as appropriate political actors, as exemplified during and after Bacon&#39;s Rebellion by the actions of-and reactions to-Lady Frances Berkeley, wife of Virginia&#39;s governor. By contrast, when the first ordinary English women to claim a political voice directed group petitions to Parliament during the Civil War of the 1640s, men relentlessly criticized and parodied their efforts. Even so, as late as 1690 Anglo-American women&#39;s political interests and opinions were publicly acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Norton traces the profound shift in attitudes toward women&#39;s participation in public affairs to the age&#39;s cultural arbiters, including John Dunton, editor of the Athenian Mercury, a popular 1690s periodical that promoted women&#39;s links to husband, family, and household. Fittingly, Dunton was the first author known to apply the word &quot;private&quot; to women and their domestic lives. Subsequently, the immensely influential authors Richard Steele and Joseph Addison (in the Tatler and the Spectator) advanced the notion that women&#39;s participation in politics-even in political dialogues-was absurd. They and many imitators on both sides of the Atlantic argued that women should confine themselves to home and family, a position that American women themselves had adopted by the 1760s. Colonial women incorporated the novel ideas into their self-conceptions; during such &quot;private&quot; activities as sitting around a table drinking tea, they worked to define their own lives. On the cusp of the American Revolution, Norton concludes, a newly gendered public-private division was firmly in place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
