  <title>The Case Against Women Raising Children - Kathleen A. Ryan Carlsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;	For information about the book go to www.GroenendaelPress.com.  
Evolution and culture produce a body and mind to suit a creatures role in the world. Whether care of the young is provided by males, females or both, each species has evolved caregiver traits suited to that task. The result is caring- women and provider-men. In other words you are what you do.&lt;P&gt; However, with the honing of each trait, a creature pays a price. In the case of a woman who specialized her body and mind to childcare, the price was a failure to develop skill at financial self sufficiency and individual direction, which in turn made it more likely that such a woman will live in a subordinate relationship. &lt;P&gt;	Women as primary parents perpetuated gender roles. Women internalized this definition of themselves, and they became somewhat comfortable with it. Even when they wanted more power over their lives, they found themselves trapped from within.&lt;P&gt;	But, human beings have also evolved the trait of educability. We can learn. We can choose the direction in which we develop our abilities and traits. &lt;P&gt;	The case against women raising children is the case for parents raising children.&lt;/P&gt;" />
