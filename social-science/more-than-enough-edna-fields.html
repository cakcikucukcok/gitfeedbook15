  <title>More Than Enough - Edna Fields</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Ever where you turn someone is talking about recession, depression, difficult times, economic down turn, doom and gloom of America in the midst of crisis. Having lived through nearly a century I have seen the rise and near fall, the up times and down times of America. In More Than Enough Edna Fields A minister, retired social worker, advocate for seniors, wife of a pasturing minster and mother of eight offer hope and wisdom for todays challenging problems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;More than Enough an easy read adds its perspective to what we are in the midst of and an approach to the solution. I begin writing this book 2010 and have watched America go through several changes. Some positive some negative, The book highlight approaches used in the history of economic recovery and points to sense of urgency of citizens involvement in light of current events.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this century we have seen growth of unrestrained greed and corruption in business, mismanagement in the halls of government, indolence of citizens. We the people must become involved.&lt;/P&gt;" />
