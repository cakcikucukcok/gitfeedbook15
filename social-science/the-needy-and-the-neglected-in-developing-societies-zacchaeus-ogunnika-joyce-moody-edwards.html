  <title>The Needy and the Neglected in Developing Societies. - Zacchaeus Ogunnika, Joyce Moody Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book utilizes sociological imagination to analyze and describe the issue of the neglected majority in human society. It focuses on how the poor and underclass including women and the disable are perceived and treated by the society and the response of the dominant class to the condition of those neglected. It attempts to see through some approaches through which the affected and the neglected, especially women, can help ameliorate their own neglect by the authority. The book saw disability as not a liability but a challenge which can be overcome by the affected. The major interesting idea in the book is the authors belief that the neglect should not believe in the utopic idea that the social system as it is constituted will come to their rescue. The authors instead assert that the success of the neglected class remains with the neglected themselves. By a concerted effort, disability will become ability, and women by cooperating in women development organizations will overcome the limitation placed on them by the society." />
