  <title>How Sassy Changed My Life - Kara Jesella, Marisa Meltzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For a generation of teenage girls, &lt;i&gt;Sassy &lt;/i&gt;magazine was nothing short of revolutionary--so much so that its audience, which stretched from tweens to twentysomething women, remains obsessed with it to this day and back issues are sold for hefty sums on the Internet. For its brief but brilliant run from 1988 to 1994, &lt;i&gt;Sassy &lt;/i&gt;was the arbiter of all that was hip and cool, inspiring a dogged devotion from its readers while almost single-handedly bringing the idea of girl culture to the mainstream. In the process, &lt;i&gt;Sassy &lt;/i&gt;changed the face of teen magazines in the United States, paved the way for the unedited voice of blogs, and influenced the current crop of smart women&#39;s zines, such as &lt;i&gt;Bust &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Bitch&lt;/i&gt;, that currently hold sway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How &lt;/i&gt;Sassy &lt;i&gt;Changed My Life &lt;/i&gt;will present for the first time the inside story of the magazine&#39;s rise and fall while celebrating its unique vision and lasting impact. Through interviews with the staff, columnists, and favorite personalities we are brought behind the scenes from its launch to its final issue and witness its unique fusion of feminism and femininity, its frank commentary on taboo topics like teen sex and suicide, its battles with advertisers and the religious right, and the ascension of its writers from anonymous staffers to celebrities in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;" />
