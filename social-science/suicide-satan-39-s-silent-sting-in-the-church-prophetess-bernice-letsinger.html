  <title>Suicide: Satan&#39;s Silent Sting in the Church - Prophetess Bernice Letsinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If I can touch only one person and stop him or her from destroying their lifes destiny through my own testimony, my God will be pleased and the enemy defeated. Suicide: Satans Silent Sting in the Church was destined to be brought forth, for such a time as this to expose the enemy and his weapons against the people of God. I wrote this book because I care for you and want you to live a joyous life in Christ Jesus. Contrary to what the enemy has tried to tell you, you can live in the fullness of joy and every promise that the Lord God has given you. When trials and tribulations (the cares of this world) weigh you down, please know that there is nothing too hard for God! He is a forgiving and loving God. His word says that He is married to the backslider. Gods love will keep you. It was His love that kept me alive to tell my story. I tell my testimony in hope that it will encourage you to live and not die. Most of you have not heard of prophetess Bernice Letsinger. I do not have a platform or a television show, but I am a woman of God, who is a wife, mother, and a person just like you who have experienced great pain in silence that only the Lord and I knew. This pain almost destroyed my life, family, friends, children, spouse, and ministry. I have no PhD, but I do have a testimony that is covered by the blood of Jesus. There is an anointing, yoke-destroying, and burden-removing power in the word of God and in the testimony of a survivor of suicide. As you read this book, allow God to heal and set you free from the sting of death. I know he will; it is already done and has been declared that a million souls will be saved just by reading this testimony. The anointing on these pages will prevent Satans silent sting from penetrating your soul thus destroy the stronghold of the spirit of suicide." />
