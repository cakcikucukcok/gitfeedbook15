  <title>Understanding the Yougoslavian Conflict - Boris Spasov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Through this essay Boris Alexandre Spasov presents us with his unique approach to and his personal understanding of the Yugoslavian conflict which shook Europe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are accompanied on a short voyage into a different world; yet one so close to home. A world where a tormented history encounters distinct national identities and gives birth to this troubled period which in spite of today’s apparent peace, contains the seeds of another explosion. A simply told story of the actual facts of the war in Yugoslavia filled with anecdotes, sometimes humorous that plunge the reader into the discovery of the particular reality of this magnificent region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;This enlightening essay will cause you to re-evaluate the country that is now ex-Yugoslavia, a land at the frontier of West and East.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yugoslavia has fallen into an insane conflict that has left a trail of destruction and suffering. For several years, we’ve watched live on our screens, the errors made by our diplomats in their “crisis management” of this war: the flaws in Western political strategy are clearly demonstrated. Only when we succeed in identifying and understanding the mechanisms that have generated and sustained the Yugoslavian crisis, will we have made progress. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &quot;humanist&quot; Boris Alexandre SPASOV, formerly Deputy Director for Europe 1, Radio Caribbean International,  graduated from the Centre d’études diplomatiques et stratégiques in Paris and is above all a man of the people, a passionate and candid eyewitness far from the safe, comfortable couch ideologies and politically correct attitudes of our time. &lt;br&gt;" />
