  <title>Detroit City Is the Place to Be - Mark Binelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once America&#39;s capitalist dream town, Detroit is our country&#39;s greatest urban failure, having fallen the longest and the farthest. But the city&#39;s worst crisis yet (and that&#39;s saying something) has managed to do the unthinkable: turn the end of days into a laboratory for the future. Urban planners, land speculators, neopastoral agriculturalists, and utopian environmentalists--all have been drawn to Detroit&#39;s baroquely decaying, nothing-left-to-lose frontier.&lt;br&gt;With an eye for both the darkly absurd and the radically new, Detroit-area native Mark Binelli has chronicled this convergence. Throughout the city&#39;s &quot;museum of neglect&quot;--its swaths of abandoned buildings, its miles of urban prairie--he tracks both the blight and the signs of its repurposing, from the school for pregnant teenagers to a beleaguered UAW local; from metal scrappers and gun-toting vigilantes to artists reclaiming abandoned auto factories; from the organic farming on empty lots to GM&#39;s risky wager on the Volt electric car; from firefighters forced by budget cuts to sleep in tents to the mayor&#39;s realignment plan (the most ambitious on record) to move residents of half-empty neighborhoods into a viable, new urban center.&lt;br&gt;Sharp and impassioned, &lt;i&gt;Detroit City Is the Place to Be&lt;/i&gt; is alive with the sense of possibility that comes when a city hits rock bottom. Beyond the usual portrait of crime, poverty, and ruin, we glimpse a longshot future Detroit that is smaller, less segregated, greener, economically diverse, and better functioning--what could be the boldest reimagining of a post-industrial city in our new century. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Detroit City Is the Place to Be &lt;/i&gt;is one of &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Top 10 Best Books of 2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
