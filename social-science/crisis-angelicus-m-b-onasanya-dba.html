  <title>Crisis - Angelicus-M. B. Onasanya, Dba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today, Nigeria is going through times of painful trial. The leading men and women who guide the countys ship of state have redefined leadership in ways that viciously hurt their country and shock the rest of the civilized world. In the hands of these leaders, the customary dignity of public office has transmogrified into demonstrations of crude brashness, service into gangster-like escapades for self-aggrandizement, concern for public welfare into cynical laughter at the agonies of the citizenry. In the circumstance, all morality has been brutalized out of sight, and basic loyalty and patriotism have been crushed. While the rulers exhaust their time in orgies of robbery of the countrys treasuries and a frenetic scramble for huge unarmed wealth, the ship of state drifts towards the shoals, and the masses of Nigerians are disoriented and shattered.
No measurable attempt now exists in Nigerias high places to understand the real nature of the country that history has bequeathed to us; all that the world hears from Nigeria from time to time are superficial and shoddy solutions for Nigerias problems, and a series of constitutions and institutions that gather nothing together.
Is there hope that Nigeria will emerge from this morass or survive it? That is not an easy question to answer. How does one envision survival for a country that is being so heavily bled!" />
