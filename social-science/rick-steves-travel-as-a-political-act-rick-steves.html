  <title>Rick Steves Travel as a Political Act - Rick Steves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Travel connects people with people. It helps us fit more comfortably and compatibly into a shrinking world, and it inspires creative new solutions to persistent problems facing our nation. We can&amp;#39;t understand our world without experiencing it. &lt;I&gt;Rick Steves Travel as a Political Act&lt;/I&gt; helps us take that first step.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There&amp;#39;s more to travel than good-value hotels, great art, and tasty cuisine. Americans who &amp;#147;travel as a political act&amp;#8221; can have the time of their lives and come home smarter&amp;#151;with a better understanding of the interconnectedness of today&amp;#39;s world and just how our nation fits in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the second edition of this award-winning book, acclaimed travel writer Rick Steves explains how to travel more thoughtfully&amp;#151;to any destination. With updated information on Europe, Central America, and Asia; an expanded discussion of the Middle East; and a brand-new chapter on the Holy Land that covers Israelis and Palestinians today, Rick shows readers how his travels have shaped his politics and broadened his perspective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The royalties from the sale of this edition will be donated by Rick Steves to Bread for the World, a Christian organization working to end hunger around the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
