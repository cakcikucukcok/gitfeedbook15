  <title>The Little Book of Steam - Clive Groome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Little Book of Steam tells the evocative story of steam railways from the end of the 18th century, when an early pioneer built a small, three-wheeled steam-powered machine. Soon after a simple steam engine was pulling coal wagons in Wales, and just 21 years later the world&#39;s first public railway opened between Stockton and Darlington. By the 1960&#39;s steam engines were on their way out to be replaced by the less romantic diesel and electric locomotives. But the steam legacy lives on, thanks to the hard work and dedication of enthusiasts.&lt;/div&gt;" />
