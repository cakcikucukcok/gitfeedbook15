  <title>Reinventing the Republic - Catherine Raissiguier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early one morning in 1996, the sanctuary of a Parisian church was suddenly disrupted by a police raid. A group of undocumented immigrant families had taken refuge in the church under threat of deportation due to the French state&#39;s increasingly restrictive immigration policies. Rather than disperse and hide, these &lt;I&gt;sans-papiers&lt;/I&gt;—people literally without papers— came together to bring to light the deep contradictions in the French state&#39;s immigration policies and practices. 
&lt;I&gt;Reinventing the Republic&lt;/I&gt; chronicles the struggle of the &lt;I&gt;sans-papiers&lt;/I&gt; to become rights-bearing citizens, and links different social movements to reveal the many ways in which concepts of citizenship and nationality intersect with debates over gender, sexuality, and immigration. Drawing on in-depth interviews and a variety of texts, this disquieting book provides new insights into how exclusion and discrimination operate and influence each other in the world today." />
