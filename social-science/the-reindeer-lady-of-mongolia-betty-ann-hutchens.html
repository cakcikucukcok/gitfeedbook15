  <title>The Reindeer Lady of Mongolia - Betty Ann Hutchens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, Betty Ann brings to light the life of the Reindeer People. During her latest visit to Mongolia, she visited the northern part of the country where beautiful lake Khovsgol is located in hopes of meeting the little known reindeer people. It was here that Miss Hutchens was introduced to the
reindeer lady - the spiritual leader of the tribe. This inspired her to write this story for children so that this race, threatened with extinction, will not be lost or forgotten.
In the Reindeer Lady of Mongolia, Betty found inspiration. Her dedication to, and her pride in, the care of the reindeer, and the way of life of the Reindeer People, was both rare and remarkable. Her life is hard, yet she does not complain. Her friendly and welcoming nature won Betty Anns heart." />
