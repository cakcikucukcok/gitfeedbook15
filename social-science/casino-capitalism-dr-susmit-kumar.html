  <title>Casino Capitalism - Dr. Susmit Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Arab Spring continues to spread throughout the Middle East, and it will end up transforming Islamic countries just as much as the two World Wars changed Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Recession that began in 2008, along with defects in the global economic system, played a large role in the unrest. During the 2000s, the economic prosperity of the United States and much of the world was based on borrowed moneyand, as it turns out, borrowed time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and economic policies of the United States complicated matters further. In this scholarly book, author Dr. Susmit Kumar examines how financial blunders have led to political upheavals in Islamic countries, as well as exploring the history of Islam and Islamic empires; the modernization of Islam; the state of the world economy, and where its headed; and the present situation in Islamic countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate future promises bloodshed and grandstanding, but in the end, the majority of Islamic countries will become secular and democratic. As with the two World Wars, a cataclysmic turn of events will ultimately unify the world as Islamic countries deal with the fallout from &lt;i&gt;Casino Capitalism.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
