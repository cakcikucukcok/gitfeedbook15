  <title>Children and Youth on the Front Line: Ethnography, Armed Conflict and Displacement - Jo Boyden, Joanna de Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	War leads not just to widespread death but also to extensive displacement, overwhelming fear, and economic devastation. It weakens social ties, threatens household survival and undermines the family&#39;s capacity to care for its most vulnerable members. Every year it kills and maims countless numbers of young people, undermines thousands of others psychologically and deprives many of the economic, educational, health and social opportunities which most of us consider essential for children&#39;s effective growth and well being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 	Based on detailed ethnographic description and on young people&#39;s own accounts, this volume provides insights into children&#39;s experiences as both survivors and perpetrators of violence. It focuses on girls who have been exposed to sexual exploitation and abuse, children who head households or are separated from their families, displaced children and young former combatants who are attempting to adjust to their changed circumstances following the cessation of conflict. In this sense, the volume bears witness to the grim effects of warfare and displacement on the young.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 	Nevertheless, despite the abundant evidence of suffering, it maintains that children are not the passive victims of conflict but engage actively with the conditions of war, an outlook that challenges orthodox research perspectives that rely heavily on medicalized notions of &#39;victim&#39; and &#39;trauma.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;" />
