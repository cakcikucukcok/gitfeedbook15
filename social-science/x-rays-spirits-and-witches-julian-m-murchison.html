  <title>X-Rays, Spirits, and Witches - Julian M. Murchison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on primary research conducted in Tanzania over the last fifteen years, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;X-Rays, Spirits, and Witches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, provides an ethnography specifically designed for use in medical anthropology classes. The text is organized around four key topics that are recurrent themes in medical anthropology across diverse settings: medical pluralism, illness narratives, embodied experiences of health and illness, and the multilayered ways that power dynamics influence healthcare. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to telling an engaging story of health, illness, and medical treatment as experienced in a real-world setting, the chapters link anthropological terms and concepts to specific events. Unobtrusive in-text definitions as well as a complementary glossary of terms help students recognize and employ the language of medical anthropology. Short pull-out boxes explore key concepts (such as the idea of &amp;ldquo;the medical gaze&amp;rdquo;) and highlight for further consideration issues which are of particular relevance in the medical anthropology classroom. Such pedagogical elements are designed to complement but not bog down the ethnography&amp;mdash;enabling students to make better connections between real-world research and core textbook concepts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
