  <title>The How and Why of Ufos - Kenneth W. Behrendt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The How and Why of UFOs&lt;/i&gt; is the much anticipated sequel to Kenneth W. Behrendt&#39;s previous groundbreaking work on the subject, &lt;i&gt;Secrets of UFO Technology.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The present work begins with a detailed review of the revolutionary anti-mass field theory explanation for UFO propulsion and its secondary effects which is critical to understanding how these craft can easily overcome the usual limitations imposed by gravity and inertia upon our present massive earthly air and spacecraft. This cutting edge theory is then applied to several classic UFO cases to provide previously unsuspected insights into them. Even the often overlooked topic of small automated alien probes is explored as a highly detailed probe case, personally investigated by the author, is presented and analyzed in order to reveal the amazing interior structures of the object sighted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After providing an analysis of the planets of origin of advanced spacefaring extraterrestrial beings, the possible reasons for their visitations to our Earth are considered. The author then goes on to describe the most likely biological mechanism behind the mental telepathy process that is the principle mode of communication for most extraterrestrial beings and even suggests a variety of simple methods that might actually allow human researchers to communicate with the alien pilots of the UFOs now operating in Earth&#39;s atmosphere! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of this is only a small sample of the many intriguing topics awaiting the reader in this abundantly illustrated volume. The many revelations found in &lt;i&gt;The How and Why of UFOs&lt;/i&gt; are sure to delight and intrigue any student of ufology who wishes to explore this fascinating subject at its very deepest level." />
