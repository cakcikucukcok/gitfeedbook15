  <title>Milton in the Long Restoration - Blair Hoxby, Ann Baynes Coiro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Milton criticism often treats the poet as if he were the last of the Renaissance poets or a visionary prophet who remained misunderstood until he was read by the Romantics. At the same time, literary histories of the period often invoke a Long Eighteenth Century that reaches its climax with the French Revolution or the Reform Bill of 1832. What gets overlooked in such accounts is the rich story of Milton&#39;s relationship to his contemporaries and early
eighteenth-century heirs. The essays in this collection demonstrate that some of Milton&#39;s earliest readers were more perceptive than Romantic and twentieth-century interpreters. The translations, editions, and commentaries produced by early eighteenth century men of letters emerge as the seedbed of modern criticism
and the term &#39;neoclassical&#39; is itself unmasked as an inadequate characterization of the literary criticism and poetry of the period—a period that could brilliantly define a Miltonic sublime, even as it supported and described all the varieties of parody and domestication found in the mock epic and the novel. These essays, which are written by a team of leading Miltonists and scholars of the Restoration and eighteenth century, cover a range of topics—from Milton&#39;s early editors and translators
to his first theatrical producers; from Miltonic similes in Pope&#39;s Iliad to Miltonic echoes in Austen&#39;s Pride and Prejudice; from marriage, to slavery, to republicanism, to the heresy of Arianism. What they share in common is a conviction that the early eighteenth century understood Milton and that
the Long Restoration cannot be understood without him." />
