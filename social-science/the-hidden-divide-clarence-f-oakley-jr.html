  <title>The Hidden Divide - Clarence F. Oakley Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I agree with you on all the points you have listed. Yet, I still need the local congregation.
-anonymous 
The Christian Right group of Churches have been consistently losing members for the last twenty years, and do not have an inkling of the cause. They have joined with the Republicans to try and enforce their will upon society. They have failed in the last two elections as indicated by the election of Barak Obama. This of course gives rise to speculation about the root basis for their beliefs and actions. This group of people claim allegiance to the whole Bible and claim that it is Gods Word. 
Many people, in light of modern knowledge, are laughing at these old time beliefs. Our society is in need of a credible way of life. The Bible has the right answer, but it is mixed in with much misleading information that the Churches have used to control society. 
The Churches have organized in such a way as to eliminate criticism. They have assumed the office of Gods representative and members can be punished for disobeying their edicts using discrimination and loss of fellowship. The Christian Right groups have refused to study and update their antiquated standards. This book is written to encourage the first step of this change." />
