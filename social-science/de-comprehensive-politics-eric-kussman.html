  <title>De-Comprehensive Politics - Eric Kussman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his ground-breaking new book De-Comprehensive Politics, Eric Kussman does a superb job of shedding light on the reason Washington D.C. is failing Americans today and then lays out a path filled with solutions which he argues will get this great nation back to the basics.
 To borrow from a sports analogy, this country has taken its eye off of the ball and if we don&#39;t want to strike out we have to get back to what has made America strong over the past 200+ years.  That is what Kussman has set out to accomplish in this amazing new book.
  Today politicians take aim at one major issue, as was done with health-care in 2010 and then pass one massive bill which nobody fully reads, that same bill gets loaded with special deals to get people to buy in to it, but at the end of the day the problem ends up worse off than when this process began.  This has to stop or America is going to be  in trouble.
  What Kussman has effectively done is he&#39;s gone beyond the broad issues in order to attack the many smaller problems, which as you will read are much easier to solve than a few really massive ones, in an honest and transparent way.  This will also allow the American public to stay involved in the political process.
  Utilizing his problem solving ability, common sense, and  vast knowledge of American history, Eric Kussman demonstrates in this explosive new book how America&#39;s problems can be resolved if Americans can start uniting in order to focus on the many smaller causes of the problems instead of trying to attack all of them at once as one giant and complex issue.
  Today more than ever America needs to look for De-Comprehensive solutions, as they will likely keep America the exceptional nation that it has been throughout its brilliant history." />
