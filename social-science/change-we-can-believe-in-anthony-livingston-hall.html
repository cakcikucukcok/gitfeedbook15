  <title>Change We Can Believe In? - Anthony Livingston Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANTHONY L. HALL&lt;/b&gt; takes aim at every important issue of our time with a unique and refreshing perspective. He comments on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obama accepting the Nobel Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Many people are still wondering what that mysterious light hovering over Norway was on the night before he arrived. But, despite claims that it was generated by a UFO or the failed test launch of a Russian missile, die-hard believers (like me) will tell you that it was just a celestial sign heralding the Nobel coming of Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The swine flu pandemic that wasnt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An Obama advisor has been quoted saying, You never want a serious crisis to go to waste It is instructive to note that the pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines, as well as the peddlers of surgical masks and other flu paraphernalia, appear to be heeding this advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Movie about Nehrus affair with the wife of a British diplomat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; One can only imagine the physical passion they shared, especially in light of Edwinas reputed nymphomania, which, notwithstanding Nehrus efforts, she reportedly satiated by making scandalous booty calls on a black man for over 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christmas Day underwear bomber&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; [W]e had the secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, assuring us on Sunday that the system worked in this case. If this good-job-Brownie faux pas doesnt suggest that our whole airline security system is devoid of logic, nothing does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cartoon of Obama kneeling and kissing shoe of Chinese leader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To be sure, the cartoon takes some creative license. But the essential point it conveys is undeniable: America cannot stand like a superpower with China squeezing its balls in a financial vise grip! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expenses scandal that rocked UK Parliament&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Who knew that the only swine flu Britons had to worry about was an epidemic of MPs feeding at the public trough like pigs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tiger Woodss Thanksgiving-Day spat with his wife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cheating Tiger, fuming dragon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
