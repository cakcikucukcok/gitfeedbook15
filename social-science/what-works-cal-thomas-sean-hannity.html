Why don’t we consult the past and use common sense in order to see that what others discovered long ago still works today? And why does present-day Washington too often look like the film &lt;EM&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/EM&gt;, with our elected officials waking up each day only to repeat identical talking points from previous days, months, and years?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Without letting politics, or ignorance, get in the way, Thomas urges readers to pay attention so that politicians can no longer pick their pockets—literally or intellectually.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What Works&lt;/EM&gt; is about solutions, not theories. It’s about pressuring political leadership to forget about the next election and start focusing on the needs of the people who work hard to provide for themselves, send their tax dollars to Washington, and want to see the country achieve something of value … like it has always done.&lt;/P&gt;" />
