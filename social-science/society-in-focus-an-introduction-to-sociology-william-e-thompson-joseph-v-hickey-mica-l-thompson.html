  <title>Society in Focus: An Introduction to Sociology - William E. Thompson, Joseph V. Hickey, Mica L. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Examining the role of mass media and information technology in contemporary society, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Society In Focus, Eight Edition, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;emphasizes the increasing diversity and globalization of societies everywhere. It is designed to help students think clearly and critically about sociological issues, concepts, and methods. Questioning is at the heart of this approach, and as students read this book they are encouraged to become part of the sociological enterprise&amp;mdash;rather than remain passive observers. Every element of the text is designed to challenge students to evaluate social issues and, guided by the sociological imagination, to clearly formulate their own positions. By asking questions that demand sociological and creative thought, students are reminded that their conclusions and decisions, as well as their non-decisions and inaction, may have important social consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
