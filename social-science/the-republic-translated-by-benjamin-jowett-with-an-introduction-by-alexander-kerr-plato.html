  <title>The Republic (Translated by Benjamin Jowett with an Introduction by Alexander Kerr) - Plato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Plato’s most famous work and one of the most important books ever written on the subject of philosophy and political theory, “The Republic” is a fictional dialogue between Socrates and other various Athenians and foreigners which examines the meaning of justice. It is primarily from the writings of Plato that Socrates’s ideas are passed down to us. Written around 380 BC, the work is an important contribution to the age old question of how to best structure a society in a just way. The influence of the analysis contained within it on the development of government and law in Western civilization cannot be overstated. “The Republic” also discusses Plato’s “Theory of Forms”, the nature of the philosopher, the conflict between philosophy and poetry, and the immortality of the soul. An essential read for any student of philosophy or political science, “The Republic” is a monumental work of classical antiquity, which forms the foundation for much of our modern public policy. This edition follows the translation of Benjamin Jowett and includes an introduction by Alexander Kerr." />
