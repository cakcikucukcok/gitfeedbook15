  <title>Before I Was a Critic I Was a Human Being - Amy Fung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In that moment, I felt closer to whiteness than not. I was completely complicit and didn’t think twice about entering a space that could cover their walls with images of contemporary Indigenous perspectives, but exclude their physical bodies from entering and experiencing. In that moment, I felt like a real Canadian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before I Was a Critic I Was a Human Being&lt;/i&gt; is the debut collection of nonfiction essays by Amy Fung. In it, Fung takes a closer examination at Canada&#39;s mythologies of multiculturalism, settler colonialism, and identity through the lens of a national art critic.&lt;p&gt;Following the tangents of a foreign-born perspective and the complexities and complicities in participating in ongoing acts of colonial violence, the book as a whole takes the form of a very long land acknowledgement. Taken individually, each essay roots itself in the learning and unlearning process of a first generation settler immigrant as she unfurls each region&#39;s sense of place and identity&lt;/p&gt;" />
