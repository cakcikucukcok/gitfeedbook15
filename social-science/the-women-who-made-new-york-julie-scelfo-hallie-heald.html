  <title>The Women Who Made New York - Julie Scelfo, Hallie Heald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;An illuminating, elegant history of New York City, told through the stories of the women who made it the most exciting and influential metropolis in the world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Read any history of New York City and you will read about men. You will read about men who were political leaders and men who were activists and cultural tastemakers. These men have been lauded for generations for creating the most exciting and influential city in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that&#39;s not the whole story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Women Who Made New York&lt;/i&gt; reveals the untold stories of the phenomenal women who made New York City the cultural epicenter of the world. Many were revolutionaries and activists, like Zora Neale Hurston and Audre Lorde. Others were icons and iconoclasts, like Fran Lebowitz and Grace Jones. There were also women who led quieter private lives but were just as influential, such as Emily Warren Roebling, who completed the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge when her engineer husband became too ill to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paired with striking, contemporary illustrations by artist Hallie Heald, &lt;i&gt;The Women Who Made New York&lt;/i&gt; offers a visual sensation--one that reinvigorates not just New York City&#39;s history but its very identity. &lt;/div&gt;" />
