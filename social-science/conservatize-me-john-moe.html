  <title>Conservatize Me - John Moe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has been said that everyone in America is firmly planted in red or blue&amp;#8212;permanently conservative or irreversibly liberal. But are we all really that locked in to the left or the right? A lifelong liberal, John Moe was determined to find out. So he reset his radio dials from NPR to Rush Limbaugh, joined some of today&#39;s most influential conservative thinkers for a series of &quot;conversion sessions,&quot; made pilgrimages to the Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon museums, and spent the Fourth of July in the most Bush-friendly county in the country, in an attempt to discover if there was actually a conservative trapped inside him yearning to be set free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conservatize Me&lt;/em&gt; is a fresh, humorous, and highly entertaining look at our country&#39;s political landscape, one that will strike a powerful chord with millions of disgruntled Americans while stimulating the mind and tickling the funny bone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
