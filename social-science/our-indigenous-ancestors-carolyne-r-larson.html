  <title>Our Indigenous Ancestors - Carolyne R. Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Indigenous Ancestors &lt;/em&gt;complicates the history of the erasure of native cultures and the perceived domination of white, European heritage in Argentina through a study of anthropology museums in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Carolyne Larson demonstrates how scientists, collectors, the press, and the public engaged with Argentina&amp;rsquo;s native American artifacts and remains (and sometimes living peoples) in the process of constructing an &amp;ldquo;authentic&amp;rdquo; national heritage. She explores the founding and functioning of three museums in Argentina, as well as the origins and consolidation of Argentine archaeology and the professional lives of a handful of dynamic curators and archaeologists, using these institutions and individuals as a window onto nation building, modernization, urban-rural tensions, and problems of race and ethnicity in turn-of-the-century Argentina. Museums and archaeology, she argues, allowed Argentine elites to build a modern national identity distinct from the country&amp;rsquo;s indigenous past, even as it rested on a celebrated, extinct version of that past. As Larson shows, contrary to widespread belief, elements of Argentina&amp;rsquo;s native American past were reshaped and integrated into the construction of Argentine national identity as white and European at the turn of the century. &lt;em&gt;Our Indigenous Ancestors &lt;/em&gt;provides a unique look at the folklore movement, nation building, science, institutional change, and the divide between elite, scientific, and popular culture in Argentina and the Americas at a time of rapid, sweeping changes in Latin American culture and society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
