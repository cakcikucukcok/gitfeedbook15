  <title>The Politics of Black Citizenship: Free African Americans in the Mid-Atlantic Borderland, 1817-1863 - Andrew K. Diemer, Patrick Rael, Richard S. Newman, Manisha Sinha</title>

The counties that lie between them also contained large and vibrant freeblack populations in this period. In 1780, Pennsylvania had begun the process of outlawing slavery, while Maryland would cling desperately to the institution until the Civil War, and so these were also cities separated by the legal boundary between freedom and slavery.
