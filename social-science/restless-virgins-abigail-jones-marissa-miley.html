  <title>Restless Virgins - Abigail Jones, Marissa Miley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An honest, intimate look at the lives of today&#39;s teens&amp;#8212;told through the true experiences of friends at a New England prep school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established in 1798, Milton Academy has a proud history of achievement. It has educated artists and CEOs; it has produced a long line of distinguished scholars and dignitaries; and it has shepherded students through the world of high-pressure academics for generations. Since its founding, the public face of Milton had always been one of integrity and pride . . . until a sex scandal rocked the campus and made headlines in the spring of 2005. The offense? Teenagers doing no more than what others had done before them&amp;#8212;except this time they got caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Restless Virgins&lt;/em&gt; is the riveting real-life story of a group of seniors who were there as the &quot;incident&quot; (as it came to be called) unfolded: Whitney, the athletic and sensual beauty every girl wants to be; Annie, who craves acceptance but is torn between the desire for peer approval and musical success; Jillian, the smart one who is sick of high school drama and desperate to go to college; and Reed, a &quot;hockey god&quot; who has it all but whose charisma masks a secret insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &quot;friends with benefits&quot; to STDs, today&#39;s teens face a wider array of social and sexual opportunities&amp;#8212;and pressures&amp;#8212;than ever before. Through its eye-opening yet sensitive depiction of a group of normal kids with normal struggles, &lt;em&gt;Restless Virgins&lt;/em&gt; offers an important look at contemporary adolescence no teen, parent, or educator can afford to miss. And it is written by two recent Milton graduates who know this world&amp;#8212;and these students&amp;#8212;like no others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
