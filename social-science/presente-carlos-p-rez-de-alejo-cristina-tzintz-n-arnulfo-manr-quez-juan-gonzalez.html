  <title>Presente! - Carlos Pérez de Alejo, Cristina Tzintzún, Arnulfo Manríquez, Juan Gonzalez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the media coverage of the increasingly heated debate around immigration reform in the United States: two dominant narratives emerge. From Lou Dobbs to Sean Hannity, commentators on the right have crafted an image rooted in fear, demonizing undocumented immigrants as a threat to national security and raising the specter of a deliberate &quot;browning of America.&quot; Left-leaning journalists, on the other hand, foreground victimization, emphasizing the plight of immigrants, stripping them of their agency.

Including a range of essays exploring the intersection of race, class, and immigration in the United States, this anthology challenges its readers to move beyond a &quot;legalization-only&quot; framework and embrace a broader vision for social justice organizing embodied in the work of grassroots organizations across the country resisting state repression, cultivating solidarity, and building alternative models for progressive social change.
