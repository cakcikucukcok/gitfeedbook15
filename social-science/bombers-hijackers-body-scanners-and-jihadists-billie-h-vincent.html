  <title>Bombers, Hijackers, Body Scanners, and Jihadists - Billie H. Vincent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the timeline relevant to Billie H. Vincents watch, terrorist attacks against world aviation are on the rise. Vincent weaves his plot with the motives of these radicals, their causes, and the religious biases for extremist Islamic Jihadist attacks on a global scale to his protagonists story. Billie has his hands full dealing with these threats and helping out other nations in their aviation security efforts. The threats and attacks, in actual terms, have left a permanent impact on Western society and aviation in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Vincent knows all the ins and outs of the business. His book is replete with all the hardcore technology that are an aficionados dream, the LED monitors light up the twilight world of the first line of defense for all airline passengers against all who might threaten the security of airports and airlines. Billie and an international company of aviation security experts come up against the attempted bombing of an international Pan-American Airlines flight to Rio de Janerio. Over the previous two weeks they had been investigating a bomb that exploded on a flight out of Tokyos Narita airport that killed a Japanese youth going to a vacation in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Vincent faces a new generation of terrorists of the era  bombs sneaked in a variety of ingenious ways into the planes and terminals abound in this dangerous world. Will he and his elite profession of dedicated men and women be able to stand up against all aviation security threats? The answer is, they will have to because the lives of innocents are at stake. Billie shows readers exactly how in this gripping &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bombers, Hijackers, Body Scanners, And Jihadists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
