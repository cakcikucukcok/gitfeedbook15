  <title>A Voice That Could Stir an Army: Fannie Lou Hamer and the Rhetoric of the Black Freedom Movement - Maegan Parker Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A sharecropper, a warrior, and a truth-telling prophet, Fannie Lou Hamer (1917&amp;#8211;1977) stands as a powerful symbol not only of the 1960s black freedom movement, but also of the enduring human struggle against oppression. &lt;i&gt;A Voice That Could Stir an Army&lt;/i&gt; is a rhetorical biography that tells the story of Hamer&amp;#8217;s life by focusing on how she employed symbols&amp;#8212; images, words, and even material objects such as the ballot, food, and clothing&amp;#8212;to construct persuasive public personae, to influence audiences, and to effect social change. &lt;p&gt;Drawing upon dozens of newly recovered Hamer texts and recent interviews with Hamer&amp;#8217;s friends, family, and fellow activists, Maegan Parker Brooks moves chronologically through Hamer&amp;#8217;s life. Brooks recounts Hamer&amp;#8217;s early influences, her intersection with the black freedom movement, and her rise to prominence at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Brooks also considers Hamer&amp;#8217;s lesser-known contributions to the fight against poverty and to feminist politics before analyzing how Hamer is remembered posthumously. The book concludes by emphasizing what remains rhetorical about Hamer&amp;#8217;s biography, using the 2012 statue and museum dedication in Hamer&amp;#8217;s hometown of Ruleville, Mississippi, to examine the larger social, political, and historiographical implications of her legacy. &lt;p&gt;The sustained consideration of Hamer&amp;#8217;s wide-ranging use of symbols and the reconstruction of her legacy provided within the pages of &lt;i&gt;A Voice That Could Stir an Army&lt;/i&gt; enrich understanding of this key historical figure. This book also demonstrates how rhetorical analysis complements historical reconstruction to explain the dynamics of how social movements actually operate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
