  <title>Owners of the Map - Claudio Sopranzetti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On May 19th&amp;#160;2010, the Royal Thai Army deployed tanks, snipers, and war weapons to disperse the thousands of Thai protesters who had taken over the commercial center of Bangkok. For the previous two months, these protesters, known as the Red Shirts, had frozen traffic at the Ratchaprasong intersection, the main space of elite consumption, economic, and physical mobility in the city. Protesters demanded democratic elections and an end to political and economic inequality. Key to this event were motorcycle taxi drivers who slowed down, filtered, and severed the movement of people, commodities, and information. In so doing,&amp;#160;they claimed a prominent role in national politics as well as ownership and control over the Thai state and its capital city.&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Owners of the Map&amp;#160;&lt;/I&gt;provides the first academic analysis of the largest social movement in Thai history to date. The author explores the emergence of the Red Shirt movement in relation to capitalist restructuring, urbanism, and street politics through an ethnographic study of some of the 200,000 motorcycle taxi drivers operating in Bangkok. This book explores the ways in which the drivers emerged as key players in the Thai political arena, using mobility and its blockages to oppose their exploitation and exclusion. Studies of capitalism concur that circulation and exchange play an increasingly prominent role in the operation of contemporary capital. Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to their operators, their everyday lives, struggles, demands and political mobilizations. This book proposes to recover their roles and explore the ways in which the mobility they operate, both physically and economically, is emerging as a field of political struggle.&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;" />
