      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;When your son responds to personal questions with a blank stare, or quickly changes the topic, you might chalk it up to &amp;#8220;boys will be boys&amp;#8221;--but still worry that something is missing in your relationship or troubling your child. You could be right on both counts. Whether your son needs to talk more, or just more effectively, this practical book will help you raise him to communicate and connect. Psychologist Adam Cox helps boys of all ages and their parents work together to overcome the innate brain differences, social pressures, guardedness, and learning and attention problems that often leave males at a communication disadvantage. With Dr. Cox&#39;s expert guidance, you can identify the camouflage boys use to deflect attention and learn useful ways to foster self-expression--from engaging preschoolers in imaginative wordplay to using creative conversation starters with sullen teenagers. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
