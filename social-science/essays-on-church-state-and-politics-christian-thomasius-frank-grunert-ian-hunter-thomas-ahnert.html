  <title>Essays on Church, State, and Politics - Christian Thomasius, Frank Grunert, Ian Hunter, Thomas Ahnert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;The essays selected here for translation derive largely from Thomasius&amp;#8217;s work on &lt;I&gt;Staatskirchenrecht,&lt;/I&gt; or the political jurisprudence of church law. These works, originating as disputations, theses, and pamphlets, were direct interventions in the unresolved issue of the political role of religion in Brandenburg-Prussia, a state in which a Calvinist dynasty ruled over a largely Lutheran population and nobility as well as a significant Catholic minority. In mandating limited religious toleration within the German states, the provisions of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) also provided the rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia with a way of keeping the powerful Lutheran church in check by guaranteeing a degree of religious freedom to non-Lutherans and thereby detaching the state from the most powerful territorial church. Thomasius&amp;#8217;s writings on church-state relations, many of them critical of the civil claims made by Lutheran theologians, are a direct response to this state of affairs. At the same time, owing to the depth of intellectual resources at his disposal, these works constitute a major contribution to the broader discussion of the relation between the religious and political spheres.&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Christian Thomasius&lt;/B&gt; (1655&amp;#8211;1728) was a German philosopher and legal theorist.
