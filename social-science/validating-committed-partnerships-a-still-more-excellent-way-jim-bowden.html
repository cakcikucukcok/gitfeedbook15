  <title>Validating Committed Partnerships: a Still More Excellent Way - Jim Bowden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although written from a biblical/Christian perspective this books theme has practical value for everyone. It presents a new relational paradigm supported by love, justice, mutuality, and other spiritual qualities. The author believes scripture teaches that all human beings are created to live in fulfilling relationships even those who are homosexual. People of faith, family, &amp; community are urged to support same gender couples by validating their committed partnership; however, nearly 50% of American citizens and church members do not support legalizing same gender marriage.   
This historical perspective on marriage reveals marriage has experienced considerable positive change and practice during the past 75 years and needs to be redefined. Until the 20th century procreation (be fruitful and multiply) was marriages major purpose. While procreation remains important,  mutuality has become the major emphasis. As written in  Genesis 2:18 (NRSV), God sought a partner for the man.  In many marriages partnership has replaced patriarchy, providing an enriching relational experience in family life.
The author presents a new relational paradigm which includes both heterosexual and homosexual couples seeking a lifelong committed relationship. Marriage of male and female and the union of same gender couples will share the title, partnership safeguarded by the same legal standards. For male and female, their title will be a marital partnership; for same gender couples their title will be a same gender partnership." />
