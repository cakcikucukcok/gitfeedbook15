  <title>Beyond the Divide: Men and Women Learning from Each Other - Mike Marvin, Christina Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gender war is over -- and if it isn&amp;rsquo;t, it should be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most people are willing to work for gender equality that leads to positive and productive relationships with the opposite sex. &amp;nbsp;Applying the current social and interpersonal tools available often leaves them feeling frustrated and exhausted. These &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; are built on a flawed adversarial system of &amp;ldquo;us vs. them&amp;rdquo; which perpetuates the gender gap &amp;ndash; a divide between men and women. Mike Marvin and Christina Lopez help men and women get beyond the divide and experience the power of working together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Marvin and Lopez collaborated, they concluded that true equality cannot be achieved until this gender gap is addressed and the culturally-reinforced division between men and women is eliminated. When men and women appreciate and learn from each other, they find new pathways to the social and civic change for which we are all striving.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The thought-provoking, strength-based solutions proposed by the authors rely on principles they have developed while interacting with thousands of people in work, educational, and family environments. Marvin and Lopez present their insightful, in-depth wisdom based on their research, training, and experience. The result is a relatable and practical guide which helps men and women navigate their personal and professional relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
