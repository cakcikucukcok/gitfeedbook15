  <title>On the Duty of Civil Disobedience - Henry David Thoreau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1849, &quot;On the Duty of Civil Disobedience&quot; is an essay by American transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau. Within it, he presents the argument that people should not allow governments to supplant their consciences, and that everyone has an important duty to avoid being pawns for injustice. A fascinating and timeless essay, &quot;On the Duty of Civil Disobedience&quot; is highly recommended for modern readers with an interest in civil disobedience, and it is not to be missed by fans and collectors of  Thoreau&#39;s seminal work. Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862) was an American poet, philosopher, essayist, abolitionist, naturalist, development critic, and historian. He was also a leading figure in Transcendentalism, and is best known for his book &quot;Walden&quot;, a treatise on simple living in a natural environment. Other notable works by this author include: &quot;The Landlord&quot; (1843), &quot;Reform and the Reformers&quot; (1846-48), and &quot;Slavery in Massachusetts&quot; (1854).  Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
